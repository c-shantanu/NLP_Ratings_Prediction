"Awesom product. From my point of view, redmi 8 is the only must buy mobile phone for moderate budget people. The battery, display, and ram & rom performs well. The speaker has huge & crystal clear voice, and the look is so hot & attractive that this phone dominates in front of other high budget phones.As such all color varients are better, but I own the Emerald green varient which is the best, awesome & appreciated & praised by all, whoever see it.READ MORE",5.0

"HONEST REVIEW FROM A HONEST BUYER !I know there are lot of pros but one major con is making everything in this phone bad .i.e the processor. The phone is very slow--the fingerprint sensor, the application handling, the typing in keyboard. So overall if you are looking for a secondary phone only for calls then you can go for it otherwise in this range go for Asus who also has the same configuration in terms of battery and RAM but with a far fast processor .Black colour model is a big turno...READ MORE",2.0
Nothing Good About this phone other than the cost...it's heavy .. the display is dull.... the rear camera is as good as a 8 megapixel...

I am writing this review after using this mobile for 6months now. First thing I observed that camra quality is not upto the mark. Second flaw is that this phone lags and hang up very frequently. Third is battery life even I do not use it for gaming or frequently checking Facebook etc still battery goes down very quickly. I would advise to avoid this phone.READ MORE,1.0

The only thing that i dislike about MI phones is their sensors are weak.You recrive call & immediately light goes off.However you try screen lights wont come.If you plan to cut the call or merge call you can't do anything.Ultimately you wait for 1 min & then if you are lucky light comes up when you press power button.Rest everything is very good.Battery weakens fast after 7-8 months but not a deal breaker as MI phone are good for max 1.5-2 yrs only.At same price other brand give smaller scre...READ MORE,5.0

Pros- The battery life is great. Lasts 2days for me. - The performance is good. It is capable of running World of Warships without much heating.- The display is good for it's price. The contrast ratio is good. Even though it is not an OLED the blacks are not bleeding noticeable light.Cons- The camera is okish. It is not that great.- The charging time is long even with a fast charger. It takes 3-4hrs depending on the charger.READ MORE,4.0

"As usual, pathetic MI phone. This my 2nd MI phone. MI phones are vulnerable to screen damage. And replacing it is costly. So if you are looking for a lasting phone. Dont go for MI. My screen got damaged in just 1 year. Started getting lines hazy screen in just 1 year. Also this particular phone hangs a lot. In a nut shell. Save money and invest in phone which lasts longer, not MI which looks good initially, but doesn't last long. I miss NOKIAüòìREAD MORE",2.0

Giving reviews after using this phone for 8 months. This phone is not up to mark as compared to Red Mi note 4 which I was using earlier. Processor is too slow. Battery backup is good that last for a day after heavy use. Display issue is there as brightness got down automatically and you have to remove auto brightness mode to get rid of it. You cannot see the display in sun light and need shadow. Camara and video quality is not as sharp and no additional features there as compared to other sim...READ MORE,3.0

"This phone performs well, and its battery also performs very well and its fast charger is a little slow but better than the Surrey charger. Its camera is not very good. Its display is slightly wider and the length is correct. But it does not look beautiful. And everyone has their own choice .Because of its money, this phone is not good, instead you should buy realme Nazro 10a.Its performance is very bad 1 year before it started to hang.READ MORE",3.0

All went well until just 2 months of usage and I am facing ""ghost touch"" issue. The buttons get pressed automatically and not able to unlock the phone due to this issue and basically not usable.

"I purchased it couple of months  back . I was initially  sceptical of it being a Chinese brand and just purchased it for my kids online learning classes , but I must say that it's a nice  device with  great quality  and in this 10000 rs odd bracket it's a device worth purchasing.  If u wanna have a nice smartphone but don't wanna spend way too much go for it.READ MORE",5.0

I had redmi note 4 before this. I thought this phone will also turn out good but unfortunately it's not 1 but 2 steps down from the note series. It's not a bad phone but you should keep your expectations to a bare minimum. Let me tell you about the good features first -1) Excellent battery2) Fast charging3) Very loud for calls and media4) Very sturdy built and feels rock solid5) Excellent rear camera6) Dual 4G VOLTE so can use 2 jio sims at once. Can also insert sd card after inserting...READ MORE,3.0

The worst product which I bought from Flipkart. This product don't have facility to share our screen during online meeting and classes. Approached service center and they don't have any reply for this issue. They only updated the software. No other action taken to resolve the issues. Rebooting time is too long and net speed very low.

Screen is hangingREAD MORE,4.0
The product is good. Worth for money to handle day to day multitasking jobs. Camera quality should have been better. And for flipkart  the exchange value they show gets much lower while exchanging even in genuine cases. It's better in other websites. Even for good mobiles they don't pay much exchange value.READ MORE,5.0

I think Xiaomi needs to improve their redmi series other wise soon they will wipe out from the market in low budget range phone. REALME NARZO series is way better than this phone.Display is not fully HD. BATTERY can be a overall highlight of this phone. I won't recommend you this phone if you are buying this for gaming. For low end handling it is good to go.To be precise if you really need to buy this phone you can but don't expect super features overall a medium segment deviceREAD MORE,4.0

My phone body had slight discoloration and the body was slightly damaged. Flipkart says the value of this damaged phone is 1500 on the app. When the agent arrived to check the phone he informed that the phone had to be in pristine condition and could not be exchanged despite flipkart saying that it can be exchanged.

The product has value for money. The great mobile is made by XIAOMI ( REDMI 8). I like it. According to me REDMI 8 is top product with 4 GB ram & 64 GB storage. Best camera quality with 12+ 2 MP rear & 8 MP front camera. Supporting 5000mAh powerful performance of battery with fast charging & based on latest operating system 9. In MIUI series. Feeling better than others with your powerful performance of processor . Like a Royal entry.READ MORE,5.0
