"Fantastic delivery by Amazon. BUT STRANGE, was not in normal Amazon packaging???USB cable faulty, careful study shows a duplicate as no ceramic finish, plus pins are not in line.Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy""",2.0
"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer. If you doubt me, check in Amazon for HP 805 cartridge. Even HP website don't have them. I can't even return the printer. When cartridge dries up, I can't buy original cartridges. May be have the printer as show piece.",2.0
"Worst printer. Just to check, gave a print for 50 black and white pages. The original cartridge got over. Original 805 model B&W cartridge would cost you around 800/-. Which means one black and white print will cost you 16/-. U can go to a photo shop and get a print on canvas at this price. Worst printer. I regret as there is no return only replacement. Please don't get cheated.",1.0
"waste  of the money to buy this printer, the link will just dry within 2 weeks if you are not using it, the new cartridge cost is very high , you buy 2 cartridge at the same cost of printer, the cost of printer ink is more then human blood. better use your own blood for printing it will be much cheaper",1.0
"FIrst of all a big thanks to Amazon for quick delivery (within 2 days). Also thanks to the delivery boy for his behavior and politeness. Really impressed.Now coming to the main topic.  I got HP Deskjet 2131 Printer at just ‚Çπ2699 during republic day sale.It is very easy to install the printer alongwith its cartridges. Its looks are superb. Printing quality is also great (I have attached the snapshot of sheet that I printed just!).  The scan feature is just rocking because it works very fast. But the printing quality should be improved.So friends, go for HP Deskjet 2131 printer without any tension.",5.0
Per page is too costly approx 16 to 40 Rupees per page do not recommend for homeIts better print the pages from outside market.Also shared in the Facebook and recommend my friends and colleagues do not purchase this printers .,1.0

"Got New and good working Product,if you don't want to buy cartridges you can use ink to refill the cartridges,ink can be found in local stores.ink is 50% cheaper than cartridges and there is a lot of link in the bottles",5.0
Don't ever buy this printer...instead go for ink tank ones...although this one is cheaper the ink cartridges will cost you the same amount in which u can buy a new printer again... not worthy from such a big brand HP...they made the printer price less but kept cartridge price the highest among all of its range...simply fooling customers..even cannot use any other cartridge and refilling was also complex.. sometimes works sometimes not :(,1.0
"Cartridge is very expensive....not recommended to buy this product .Not Cost effective at all ,Priniting from local shop will be cheaper than printing at home",1.0
"Good printer for home use.1. Very easy to install and use. Installation directions comes with product.2. This printer has no WiFi functionality. Hence, needs to be connected with laptop/desktop with a cable while printing.3. Print speed is ok, not great (very fast)4. Double side printing is not automatic. Need to manually feed the pages back to printer if we need printing on both sides of the page.4. Copy (Photostat) functionality is good. Can copy both in color and black&white.5. Scan functionality is also good. Once the necessary drivers are installed as part of the installation and printer is added to laptop/desktop, one will understand how to use the scan functionality.",5.0
"I purchased this product in 2017 during Amazon sale. This printer is very easy to use and very friendly but cartridge is the biggest issue. With the company provided catrdige, you would be able to hardly print 15 to 20 sheets. If you do not use the printer even for 2-3 days, the ink will dry and you will have to replace the cartridge.Each catridge would cost approx 1000 and you would be able to print max 90 pages and each page print would approximately cost you 11 Rupees, which is very bad.I sold this in OLX for 1.5k and brought a ink based printer from Epson for 6.5K. This printer prints 6000 sheets for a catridge worth 500. The cost of each color print would be approximately 18 Paise.Think well before you buy this printer.",1.0
"Finally after spending two days on it, I was able to install the drivers on mac1. Download Hp easy start2. Click contw, it will connect to hp.com and ask to download Hp smart software(This software doesent detect the printer)3. Click cross button (the one to close the app)4.You will get three options. Click skip to software download5.It will start searching for software, if it doesent detect printer, hold power off button of printer for few seconds and click restart6. Now you will be able to install the drivers.",5.0
The printer called is very best than compared to 10000 worth of rupees printer and I am using the printer for my life time user can have that why because the printing called is superior than Canon laser are made any Epson printer I am using the cartridge buy refilling the ink by injecting so the print rate for each black and white pages but at least 10 piece just timepass only and the colour print called as a 25 may be when you are using refilling the cartridge through injection so I already purchased some of ink refilling in c m y k from your Amazon website they also good everything is good regarding this product I give five out of 5 marks,5.0
"Pros-Print quality is really great.-Print speed is fast compared to its previous models.-Installation is very easy.-Works with OTG cable in Android-Lightweight-Good Build qualityCons-Works with OTG cable in Android (However you cannot adjust the print size or quality. It just prints a single image on full size page)-The software immediately displays the ink levels as half empty even if you just printed a single page.-Ink is too damn costly.If you have an occasional use of coloured printing, go for it. It's the best in price range. But for regular use it'll put a whole in your pocket.",5.0

"Not that much of good quality printer it is, I have order two printers instead of one, unfortunately it was happened by amazon's recommendation options for sure. The tech team and the seller should take care of this feature when its availing to any of customer its getting automatically adding two quantity in the cart section, I was usually do double check but I missed to confirming this time. My bad! Amazon tech team is also not ready to help me out. They saying that as per our policy is not allowing us! I'll tell one thing Amazon team! ""Policies are only made for product not for humans' tech activity mistake!""",2.0
It is a good printer.. I would say the bestBut its only good if you print for like 15-20 pages a month .. (mostly for home use)I ordered this for my study room..So I print for like 15 pages a month ..If u r using it at home or will consume it less then this is the right product..If u are looking for an office use or you will use it everyday then this product is not for you...I would recommend you to go for other optionsBut for few prints (home use) its the best productEasy to use / install / clean etc..I loved it .. it worked for meLookwise üëçPrinting quality üëçColour print üëçOver all A BIG THUMBS UP üëç ONLY FOR...,5.0

"One of the worst purchase i have ever got from amazon..reasons to justify are as below.1)First of all the outer box is not completely sealed..2)printer is not a brand new one,its a product returned by someone..we can clearly see the invoice of others..3)both the ink catridges are missing from this peice.How can someone dispatch an used item and more over without even seeing wether box has all the products.Terrific customer experience.",1.0
"This printer is a very cool deal in this price point. You can print , scan and copy easily. I personally liked this product. It is best suitable for home use. However printing rate is a little slow but it produces high quality prints.Based on my observations, I can say that -1) Printing speed - 7/102) Print quality - 10/103) Command (how fast it catches the commands) - 9.5/104) Durability - 9/105) Scanning - 10/106) Functioning of buttons placed on the printer - 10/10One more thing that I can see on this printer that it will not catch the paper on the tray if only one is placed. You have to manually press that single paper so only your printer will recognize it.Otherwise everything is good.",5.0
"I bought it at very affordable price of 2500‚Çπ. It's really easy to install. One can search for installation process on YouTube and then follow the procedure. Print quality is too good. The best feature is that it's 3 in one printer which can print, scan and copy. The thing I didn't liked much about it is cartilage which may dry up so you need to use the printer in every 2-3 days. All the cartilage can finish after printing 100 pages. It's good for those who use it for personal home use.",5.0
"If you know how to remove a few pieces of sticky tape and follow pictorial illustrations to slot in the ink cartridges, the initial setup is easy. What is not so easy is getting HP's Smart App to work. It's an utterly senseless interface with ambiguous prompts and instructions. Once you have figured out that you don't need to 'add' the already installed printer, then you run into a regularly freezing app. Thank goodness for Ctrl-Alt-Del. HP offers no advice or good solutions for their Smart App's freezing problem. There is a workaround though, which I finally discovered after trying umpteen number of things. Terrible terrible 'Not-Smart' app. Print quality is OK. Scan quality is poor.",3.0
"Printer is budget product for home use, but original ink is a big scam, 2 Rs. manufacturing cost of product has MRP Rs. 754/-. And local ink refill will not work every time, Sometimes cartridge will failed, some time printer will block the cartridge. and indicator light will blink continuously.  Reset and other tricks available in youtube will not work once cartridge blocked.",1.0
"ABOUT THE PRINTER:-user-friendly, medium-sized not too big or too small. good for desk and personal use.2 ink cartridges come with the printer. it's a light lavender coloured printer which I love. there's no printing paper with it.HOW TO INSTALL:-so I am writing this because I myself had never used a printer in my life on my own.1. remove the covers and plastics and the cardboard inside protecting the ink slots. adjust the paper alignment (the paper alignment bar can be moved to adjust) and close the inner door from where the print will come out, only open the outer door.2. connect the wires to your laptop/desktop and go to the website provided in the pamphlet.3. follow the instructions from the website and you're done!!hope it helped :)",5.0
Defective product. After installation almost I have wasted my 2 hours with HP team for getting my problem resolution of paper not loading.. and they have assigned an engineer for resolution of the same ...25-Jan-2021: As per HP care Team product is faulty and needs to be replaced.27-Jan-2021: Replacement product received. Which is also faulty and now a refund is initiated.In case you want to waste you 1 week for this long process go ahead and purchase this trouble box.,1.0
"It is simply impossible to understand as to why HP cannot create a simple installation system. You have to first download an app which then refuses to recognise the printer and keeps asking to ""connect"" the printer when it is already connected! In three days after delivery, I have somehow managed to install the printer on two laptops and still waiting for HP app to work on one more laptop. All in all, utterly third grade product. I had canon printer earlier which was fast easier to install and operate. Not surprisingly, HP has named its printer driver as ""HP Smart"" - it is the dumbest app around",1.0
"I was using an HP 1515 all-in-one printer for several years but it got stuck with a paper jam problem. It did not have any setup cartridges, but this 2331 printer is having them. Instead of simplifying setup, HP is making it more and more complicated. Since the setup cartridges are to be thrown out after a 5-minute use, they only serve the purpose of eco-unfriendliness. I can manage with this 2331 because I am running a one-man business.",1.0
"On time delivery by Amazon. Print quality is GOOD, on par with any other printer at this price range. But canon mg2570s & mg2577s are cheaper & comes with cheaper cartridges (something I observed).  It takes some time for the Scanning & printing process but thats normal for home use & even OK for small home business uses. The lid hinge looks & feels quite flimsy though.  Installation process was hassle free. Online Registration was swift. Hp's app is super easy to use just uninstall the bloatware ;)  Refill cartridge is some what expensive but thats inevitable with any inkjet printer (no point in blaming only hp for that) but canon's 745s black & 746s color cartridges are relatively cheaper, (around 200/- less)  Overall Good product, at the price of 3K it gets the job done without any trouble.",4.0
"Best in this price. Budget friendly.The print quality is awesome for colour and black and white print both.We never used printer before but installation was very easy.Yes, print speed is bit slow but we don't need to open a shop, in 3400 INR it serves more than it needs to be. Scanner is awesome and fast too. I am truly satisfied with the purchase.It is being used frequently by all of us in our family.",5.0
"Print quality is good. The ink that comes with the printer is demo one, good for around 25 bw and around12 color pages. After that, the new ink cartridges are costly. Almost 12 rupees per bw and 20 rupees per color sheet. If you use it frequently to do not go for this.",3.0
"Please don't buy this printer seeing the cost. The cartridges finished super fast and absolutely does not work if you try to refill it back. The cartridge is of course qay expensive. We already had a hp printer but after a while you obviously don't get the cartridge (ploy to sell new models understood). Got this one for OCCASIONAL printing, but now having a bad headache coz of it. Less than a star.",1.0
Usng it is very costly the cartrigde ends very soon and then when you want to buy a new one it's about half the price of printer.! cartridge prints not more than 40 pages My printer After the 2 cartridges which were included with it got over i could not dare to buy new one because of its price and so i threw my printer,1.0
"this printer received as faulty; xerox & scan functionality never worked.contacted amazon for return straightaway; but as it's under warranty of HP, the only way is to contact HP to fix it.HP engineer came up and detected faulty scanner head and promised to replace it soon; now it's more than 2 months and still waiting it to be fixed.disappointed, AVOID !",1.0
Print quality is ok.. Not good for printing on smooth surfaces because ink does not dry. Not good for printing on both side u need to change paper manually. Color cartage gets over in 50 pages black and white in 65 print speed is slow 3  color paper per minute 5 back and white per minute. Scan takes 5 minutes.. But the thing is every function works it is all in one printerIf u refill it with fake turbo inks the printer finds it and the printer software shows there is no ink.. But it can print..,3.0

"HP DeskJet 2131 Is an amazing Printer to go for in A budget option. Although it's a cheaper option the printer is pretty good You can Print, Scan & copy[zerox in both colour and b&w].If you use a good quality paper results are extraordinary.A few cons.1. The stock carterage is terrible it's a very poor quality.2. Carterages are not reusable3. I received a damaged carterage.4. Cost cutting is highly observed over the printer.5. Also no proper information on how to use the printer via laptop",5.0
I just bought the cheapest printer I could find for myself and turns out to be a good and worthy printer.. just that I found inserting a single sheet of paper is not very easy and seems like it has to be forced in.. but inserting more than 2 is easy and fits well.,5.0
Easy to use watched a youtube video for installation. Tried to take a photo print quality could be better. Can xerox.documents without a computer. Had to install driver online for scanning. Printer configures easily. If you can afford makes a bit of sense to spemd. 2k more for a wifi printer. All in all for 3k a home printer which can scan/Xerox is a good deal,4.0

"The black cartridge had worn out soon. Other cheap inks are not much of a use. If not used daily, concussion will form in the cartridge. Much bigger job.

"I have purchased it about 6 months ago mainly for scanning, but not satisfied with scanner quality. Its scans blue ink signature as black and violet color stamp also not as violet as actual is, in other words its scan does not give true colors.
