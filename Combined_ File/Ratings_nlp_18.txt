review,rating
Material quality is just like any other headphones there is nothing special or specific about this though its price is 400 bucks.The cable is not tangle free like the boat 225 model. But a band is given along with the headset to keep it from getting tangled. This is the only thing I liked about this headset.Sound quality I must say is the worst. There is added noise to the audio. I think the cheaper models from other brands like Philips and Mi headphones are much better in this aspect. Or it's better to go to the next variant in the same brand boat 225 bassheads instead of buying these.Durability is something that I can't say as of now. As I haven't used it long enough to comment about it.,2.0

  ¬†1} Sound quality is amazing for the price üòç2} Built quality is good but not the best but for the budget price I can say its good ‚ö°3} Headphone jack is not gold plated ‚ö†Ô∏è4} I have been using this earphone from past more than a year and have replaced it once under warranty which was super easy hassel freeüé∂5} I have used many other brand earphones such as JBL, Sony, Sennheiser, RHA, Boultaudio and recently Infinity and I am not a professional but have experience of many earphones so I can say this is the best sounding in budget and very comfortable in shape to use for longer duration üíØüí•",2.0
"Very much dissatisfied of the sound quality of Boat-100.Clairity of the sound is very poor.I don't get any return option for this product. Other wise  definitely I will go for return. Only I can go for replacement with same product.Waistage of money.I have purchased two headphone in 399/- one Boat-100 and another Mi basic headphones. Mi has the much better sound quality then Boat.Inform to manufacture of Boat, don't waist your money in Advertisement and others fixtures. Please improve the quality of the product.Quality talks everything no one need to say anything.Very much dissatisfied.",2.0
"It is a filmsy product seriously. I mean it might have worked well for few, but these products have lot of inconsistencies in production. The product stopped working in 2 months. Return window closed. Stuck. Need to order a new one. If you are buying you are taking a chance. Good luck.",2.0
The sound quality is average as there is too much of base and no treble but then you can‚Äôt expect much at a price which is literally a steal .The newer earphones from the same company have more bass and thump and the clarity of sound is well calibrated.The ergonomics is quite well distributed with its sleek design and style.Overall it‚Äôs an average buy and if are that person looking for sound and bass this particular model might not suit your needs but the alternative models could help the cause,2.0
Read fully..Review when I just got them: Budget yet great pieces of earphones.. quality is uncompromised..To sum up . If you're low on budget and yet you need great earphones.. this should be your top choiceEdit: nope they lasted for 5 months and then boom they just stopped working.. if I was listening to a video only the bgm was audible and the voice layer was gone.. even in songs.. and same with calls.. I had to order a new set I hope they don't disappoint me . üôÑüòë,2.0
"Nothing especial in this earphone other than a third class design and somewhere in minus class of quality. The quality of the cable is in line with ‚Çπ15.00 chinese lights we use in Diwali. Noise cancellation is such that dont u dare to listen something private in front of others, the same time there is a positive point that u may also use earphone in speaker modes as you will very well listen what is playing inside of them...Regarding Bass.,,,.why the hell does they and others calling it a basshead without knowing its meaning, no bass as i have used it in both android and my apple...Final verdict is that at price point of view this can be considered a better option if you cannot go to the nearby railway station to buy something better in ‚Çπ100 only..And i bought the red colour as no other colour option was available and now scared of taking and showing it to others bcoz of its quality and look...Thanks",2.0
"The sound is 6/10,comfort6/10,Build quality and the wire 8/10The biggest disappointment is the design which has the mic. way down. Almost at the 2nd button of your shirt increasing the distance from the mic and from your mouth a point where the other caller cant hear you at all.Instead I got the mi earphones which are almost the same price but way better.",2.0
"All thing wS good.but base is little low. I used many headphones like Samsung original,  Sony,  this boat, hitage , joie etc. But hitages was good and satisfying me in 250rs from local market. Also boat headphones not fit in my ears. So im not satisfied to this.... if u r normal sound lover then u can try else do not buy try differ.",2.0
i didnt expect from boat company but above ratings are good when i buyed i got that this is a waste there is no bass and no noice cancellation just i felt when i plugged this is like a 100 rupess footpath totally waste dont waste ur time and dont by this stupid product but boat company is good because i had boat meatallish 100 is working awesome,2.0
"In the left one the volume is very low. Because of this the overall experience is getting affected.Also, the mike is too low and you have to hold it up. This is annoying because the whole purpose of headset+mic is to be hands-free. Or you have to talk really loud for the person on line with you to hear properly which defeats the next main usage of headsets for calls - having a private conversation in a public area.",2.0
I have been buying boat products for about 2 years now and i have always been happy with the quality they deliver.but this time i was dissapointed.the mic has to b kept alomst on ur chin or above otherwise the voice is not audible to the other person . And also during call the volume is less ..i would not reccomend this one..,2.0
I bought a headphones before it for 800rs . When I lost that I bought it for same quality expectations. It's cheaper than that but it was discounted price so I expect for same quality but it's not upto mark .It's an average headphone.Find something better and tell me pls.,2.0
Its an average product.. Sound quality and bass is below expectations. Sometimes when the jack moves the sound in one ear bud stops then I adjust it and it comes again and this is something which started within 2 weeks of use. Not money well spent.,2.0
One side of the earphone stopped working in 3 months n till now no response from Boat after registering warranty complaint...called their customer care the line gets disconnected n nobody bothers to call back.,2.0
I bought this in march.. and now it's November.. In the end of october one of the earphone was working but after a week both are not working.... this was not expected.. verryyy very disappointedüòî..if this gonna happen what's difference between those cheap earphones and a Boat one..,2.0
The Mic is too far from mouth and cannot be adjusted. I need to bring the mic near my mouth everytime I need to speak. This does not serve my purpose. The sound quality is good enough though.,2.0
It was not at all what I expected it to be.Yes if you are reading this review please don't buy or you will definitely Regret it.It only has a good looking design everything else is not even as good Chinese earphones which you could buy for rs 100 or even less.Sound quality is below average.Bass is also not up to the mark.Its earbuds are though they are made up of plastic ( quite a hard and uncomfortable ).It's quite a disappointment overall.,2.0
"Started malfunctioning after 4-5 months, got replacement with warranty claim. Replacement started doing the same thing after 15 days.1. Volume changes automatically like a faulty connection between wires.2. Left and right side started playing on different audio volume from each other.",2.0
It is a great product but.......it is not even durable as it will definitely stop working after a couple of months......I bought this product in February......and now it stopped working....like one earphone is not working now......and if you see the warranty thing.....it takes alot of time..as the video suggests it will be recovered within a month....that's not true baby.........it takes atleast 5 months .,2.0
"Gone by the brand name, I purchased this one. But, hasn't met the expectation.  Ears stats paining if i keep the ear plugged for 30+ min. No noise cancellation. The receiver can hear the surround sound better than what I speak. I wouldn't recommend this one.",2.0
"This product is cheap and offers quality for the price. But the ear pieces stopped working after 3 months of use. Though they have 1 year warranty, the website to claim warranty is not working. No one replies to your email and no one picks up your call. Why do these companies invests loads of money on marketing rather than building a good product and having a good customer service. I'll never order again and never recommend this brand.",2.0
"The quality is satisfactory for phone calls, but even after careful usage, one string has torn within 2 months. It is not suitable for high-quality music listening and noise cancellation.",2.0
I got it for 379inr.Kindly avoid if you can afford to spend more.low sound /volume compared to three year JBL I got for 500inr.Use strictly for calls.The call button didn't work for me either.Maybe poor QC.,2.0
Customer  please don't choose boAt brand as an headset purchase  .Please choose another because I purchased it on September 21. 2018  . First 1 month headsets have no complaints then sound was not clear after user 1 month no bass effects . 1year warranty is really waste for this product i cannot claim my warranty it's really waste don't buy this product .,2.0

"I just bought based in Reviews. But it has extreme volume, u can't hear for a long hours.Base"" its not a good quality- its like a bunch of all sounds that's all. its simply basic headset.For music Lovers, this is not for u. Go with better one.No volume button in this.",2.0

If u have budget around 500 , better to buy Boult audio loupe earphones. I have actually buyed this on seeing the brand boat ,but it doesn't deserve it. Overall rating is 5/10. It works like rs.100 earphones and if u compare with mi basic earphones, mi basic are the best in all rounder. please don't buy it, At this price range many other earphones are there .",2.0
"It just worked fine for a one and half month suddenly it started giving sounds and then it totally stopped and my brother's one is only working on one side, the sound and packaging is all great when it arrived, I ordered Sennheiser llike 6 month back before lockdown I guess it's still working fineeee! I won't recommend to buy this one.",2.0
I purchased this because of the good experience of my earlier headphone.This headphone looks good and cheap but this is having quality problems.  I keep getting a crackling noise on my moto g5s plus. sometimes one side earphone stops sounding during a call. This works relatively good on PC.Not recommended.,2.0

Issue with mic may arise.Bad customer supportIts been 3 months since I bought these earphones and the mic of the earphone stopped working so I tried contacting customer care and even tried visiting one but the outlet was not there it had been shifted somewhere else and they had not updated on their website. Also you'll get no help from customer service number or e-mail.,2.0
Sound quality is ok good not as much as i expect from boat. Bass was not good and cannot be use for long time also does not have noise cancellation.I like zebronics(my old earphone) more than boat.,2.0
Not bad for the price but for one major exception... The mic placement is highly unintuitive. It is near the chest so you will have talk louder or hold it physically near your mouth.,2.0
If you're someone who uses headphones for calling and speaking then I definitely do not recommend these earphones. The mic quality is really bad and it got spoilt within two months of use.,2.0

As per my view Sound quality is very bad..By spending this amount in local market you can get a excellent headset.there is no bass at all..if you have some knowledge then you can enhance only some bass in equalizer in your mobile..thats it..You can't do anything more than that.,2.0
"If built quality is your one of your priorities then don't go for it, built quality is like 50 rs Chinese products. Expected a bit more at this price.

After all it's your call.",2.0

"I'm generally a fan of boAt products, but this set of headphones is just not worth it.For one thing, the sound quality is pretty poor - those free headphones that you sometimes get at promotions or events have had better sound quality than this. It definitely does not provide the clarity that forms the base of good headphones.It's not all that comfortable to wear either. My ears start to hurt shortly after wearing it.The microphone works well and everything else (if there's anything left at all) is all well and fine, but to me, this product just seems like that kid who's just trying hard to fit in with the ""cool gang"" - with it's fancy hawk design and all - but failing in performance.",2.0
"Very poor in quality. The amount for the product is too high. The picture of the product shown in the amazon store is not real, because the 3.5 mm headphone jack is golden color in that picture, but actually it is poor quality steel jack.I never suggest this headphone to buyers. If this will get for some 150 or 200 Rs. it is okay....",2.0
I have no doubts on the sound clarity and beats. It doesn't fall off often from your ears.But the bad thing is you can't listen songs for more time as it gives an ear pain and headache.I have still faith in boat products but this one is not that worth.,2.0

The product worked pretty decently for 4 months and today right ear stopped working. It can be covered under warranty I guess will update later but when I checked we have to go to their service centres to get it repaired unlike what they did last time I have BoAt rockerz 450. They picked my headset and repaired and gave it back to me. But mind one thing this whole process took 1 month like seriously!  I live in navi Mumbai and when I tried to track the product I came to know that they repair it at Thane one can reach Thane from Navi Mumbai in 1 hour. Their service is good but very slow!,2.0

Although the sound quality is fine but the base in these earphones is not on point. I love EDMs and base is the real music for me these earphone make the music blant and without bass it sounds like there is salt missing in ur curry.,2.0
