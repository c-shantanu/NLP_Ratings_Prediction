I bought this product because I edit videos for a living.I have a YouTube channel: KTNTECH (You'll find the unboxing and impressions video there)If you're a gamer do not go with this one.Because it's an IPS Panel the response times are a lil less and there are tad bit jelly effect while gaming.If you're a photo/video editor definitely this is for you at least on this budget.Thanks for reading.Don't forget to check out the channel :),5.0
"Bought this monitor on 5th Jan 2018 at Rs. 15,499 in lightning dealFollowing are my observations:1) The first thing I noticed is that top and side bezels of the monitor are very thin which is aesthetically pleasing and gives it a premium look.2) Screen is decent and has good brightness and contrast. Not sure about color reproduction but it feels alright.3) Screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz at 1920x1080 resolution. However it has an option of 75 Hz at 1024x768 resolution also.4) Even though this monitor has Eye Care (Bright Intelligence), I felt that the sensor adjusted brightness is on higher side for my liking.5) There is slight backlight bleed at top left corner of monitor which is noticeable only in very dark environments but overall has uniform IPS Glow.6) Response time mentioned on the box is 5ms (Gray to Gray) and I felt it to be good for FPS games. Overall, it's a good monitor for casual gaming.7) It comes with UK style power cord and needs a converter/adapter or a spike guard will work.8) The box also includes HDMI cable and the monitor has cable management as shown in product description which I felt is a nice addition to the package.Monitor has following ports:D-SubHDMI PortDisplay PortLine-in port and3.5 mm jack for plugging in earphonesThis monitor also has in-built speakers which are pointed downwards. The quality of audio from them is nothing to brag about and max volume is that of a typical tablet (my iPad Pro 12.9"" 2017 has better sound output than them) but no complaints here considering the price of the monitor.Overall this monitor is value for money product considering the price I got it for.Cheers to Amazon for on-time delivery.Feel free to ask any questions about the product, will be glad to help!",5.0
"I have worked on many monitors (Dell, HP, Acer) in office and home. Never had a Benq. I will get this out of the way, my favourite brand is Dell (I have bought around 10 products). I was torn between the Dell (2717H), Viewsonic and Acer. For some reason I never had a good experience with products of HP.My requirement was a 27"" monitor. I am not a serious gamer only play casual games from time to time. The main purpose was to do programming and watching videos (and reading). This monitor suits perfectly.Pros:- Excellent display. It had a bit of light bleed on top right corner but it was just the glass a bit out. I just pressed it in and the bleed was gone.- Good contrast and viewing angles. I have not played any FPS games till now but overall the experience till now (10 days) has been smooth and consistent. The 5ms response time is good enough for me.- Although it is a 1080p display, the text and videos appear sharp, no pixelation or ghosting. Colours are uniform and even.- Bluelight filtering is good. Helps when reading a long book / article and puts less strain in the eyes.Cons:- The Eyecare feature is a bit aggressive. The display becomes too bright for the surrounding light. I just switched it to standard and set the brightness and contrast to levels I am comfortable with. The day/night light in my room doesn't differ much so I don't need to change the settings.Other monitors with similar features were around or over 20k, I got this for 17k. Overall a very good budget monitor. It also has 3 years warranty which is good and tells that I can expect a pretty long life from this.Let me know if you need to know more.",5.0
"I bought it mainly for its auto brightness. But, the brightness doesn't go too low there is no light around. So, I had to stop using the feature that I especially looked upon. Anyway, it's a value for money product. Good fit for someone who uses it occasionally. Not recommended for you are going to stare at the monitor for around or over 8 hours a day. For such use cases, better to go for Dell ultrasharp monitors. They are costly, but your eyes would thank you for sure.",4.0
"I was skeptical about this BenQ G480 eye care 24” inch monitor first. After a lot of research, I found this monitor too good for regular reading and office work. I previously had a DELL 21.5 inch monitor which that has a really thin bezel on the side and the top. Further, it is quite good in color production along with two fine speakers at the bottom.Now, for the last 1 year, I had this severe pain in my eyes as I mostly work in front of the screen. The pain gradually increased at times I couldn’t even stare at the screen perhaps, due to the harmful blue light emission. I was waiting for the shopping days to come up where I can buy a decent monitor(bigger size) and also that could help me get rid of severe eye strain.As I already use blue cut lenses I did not find the previous monitor abstain harmful blue light. And this time I have decided to buy the BenQ monitor 24 inches (Eye Care). I did not expect to be excellent in color production either I play games using this.After, I received the monitor which I purchased just for 7.8k during the festive season deal.I found the feature “Low blue light” and “Brightness intelligence technology” - uses a dedicated sensor to map out the ambient lighting to adjust the temperature and brightness of the screen which seriously I have never seen on budget monitors.Anyways, I am quite happy with the purchase I have tested and experienced no flicker issue neither extreme blue light emission after you have just switched to “Low blue light emission”.In addition, I received a major upgrade to 24 inches that allow me for seamless reading. Moreover, the monitor comes with 36 months of on-site warranty but sadly, you can register the monitor on their website there is no option to do that.I have seen people complaining about the screen bleeding issue. Fortunately, I did not face anything yet.I am in love with my new 24 inches BenQ monitor irrespective of having 5 ms response and limited to 60Hz refresh rate. This monitor is perfect for and reading, working for a longer duration but can’t say about photo or video editing work. I purchased the monitor mainly seeing the eye care technology that puts less strain on eyes even after continuous usage of 6 hours.I have attached several photos of the monitor and how it looks exactly. Also, I have tried to show the features that you can access using the buttons beneath the screen.",5.0
"The monitor is well built.  Quality is also good.  However, It's painful for the eyes if you do text based stuff.  The fonts will look blurred.  It seems that 22inch or lower size monitors are best for Full HD Resolution.  24inch monitor will have larger pixels which will make text blurry and affect eyes.  If you just want a bigger monitor, spend more money and go for Ultra HD ones.  Otherwise, you may regret it as I have. Looking forward to selling mine!",3.0
"This monitor is really good at this price point ( I got it for 9499 during amazon sale )Pros:1.Colors are much more Vibrant then normal LED's, i have a triple monitor Setup so i can compare this with other LED's  from dell.2.Dark and Bright values are much better differentiated.3.The best one is the price you cant get any thing better than this at this price Point...Kudos to Benq for that4. Brightness is way too much high5. Multiple connecting options ( i plugged it to my PC as well as my PS4)Cons1. There is some back light bleeding ( But that is ok even expensive monitors has minor light bleeds)At this price point i think Benq has done a great job.if you want a cheap IPS display then this monitor is for you.",5.0
"The BenQ 27 is an amazing monitor the most interesting that I loved about this monitor is its slim bezels on the sides and top. I've connected it with Laptop and the output quality is uncompromised and looks good. it also has an inbuilt speaker (but I never used it because it's not good in my opinion).Moreover, the texture on the display is well finished with Matte so it could block glossiness and reflection. The monitor comes with a control panel to adjust different settings related to colors and sound. It also comes with a set of Color schemes preset, which are also customizable. Right beside the control panel buttons, it has a power LED indicator too.My overall experience with this monitor is amazing.",5.0
"Good product, performance is excellent and exceptional difference or upgrade in my viewing experience. Suggest the product to buy if anyone is thinking to buy one in budget, though I still have a doubt whether it is an LED or LCD as I received a manual saying LCD in the packet.I wish to buy one more if I get a clarity on this LCT/LED thing ..",5.0
"I bought this in late December 2019 for 12.9K. I had switched to this from a 22 inch LG monitor (model 22MP68VQ, to be precise). The color reproduction on that monitor was downright brilliant. So, when I plugged this one in out of the box, to be honest, I was somewhat disappointed. The colours looked so faded and unappealing, the blacks were nowhere near black and the overall panel appeared to be so low quality, that I almost contemplated returning it.However, when I tinkered with its settings, boy was I amazed. The color reproduction improved massively, including the contrast and brightness. I also made some changes to the Intel display driver's setting (mine is a Windows system), however, that might be different for you based on your system.First and foremost, go to ""Picture Advanced"" menu on the OSD (on-screen display), and set Picture Mode to ""User"". This will turn off all settings such as Bright Intelligence, Low Blue Light, etc. (Trust me, you don't want to keep them enabled for the best picture quality). Then navigate to ""Picture"" tab in the main menu. Here are the monitor's settings that worked really well for me:1. Brightness: 100 (you may lower it if it hurts your eyes)2. Contrast: 603. Sharpness: 54. Gamma: 55. Color Temperature: Normal6: Hue: 507. Saturation: 50Once you have tweaked settings to the above numbers, you will see it greatly improves the picture quality. However, if you have an Intel display driver like I do, you can tweak the settings there too for an even better picture. Here are the steps for that:1. Search ""Intel Graphics Command Center"" in start (this may be different for you if you're running an older driver). If you can't find it in start,  you should be able to right-click on your desktop and go to Intel Display Settings too.2. Navigate to the ""Display"" tab.3. Go to ""Color"" tab in the window.4. Leave ""Brightness Enhancement"" to default at 50.5. Change ""Contrast Enhancement"" to 48 from 50.6. Enable ""Luminance-based Color Model"". (THIS IS A MAJOR GAME CHANGER)And voila! Your these settings would breathe a new life into an otherwise dull default settings.One thing to note here is that the piece that I received had slight IPS glow / backlight bleed from upper left corner, mostly noticeable in very dark environments with 100% brightness (see attached picture). However, it is very common in IPS displays, and gets worse as the screen size increases. I didn't want to gamble with a replacement product, so I chose to stick with this one. Mine came with zero dead pixels, so I was worried about the replacement being worse (more backlight bleed / presence of dead pixels).",5.0

   The product is very good. Eye care setting has options like Multimedia, Reading etc...  I usually keep Multimedia while playing games and Reading when I am coding and doing office work. I usually spend 8 hrs per day infront of PC, I didn't experience any eye strain. Vertical adjustment is not there, so if you have comfortable chair and table, it's good. Inbuilt speakers are good enough. Like other commented, I did not expect a home theatre like speakers from a monitor. Its suitable for hearing computer sounds and attending meetings with client. Build quality is good. I bought it for 7750Rs, Because of Corona pandemic prices are increasing, I don't have any option and didn't wait for the deals. I feel happy for purchasing this.",5.0
After using the monitor for 2 weeks I noticed that the top part of the screen has a white spot and also the edge of the monitor is open from the top (pic attached). The return date is now over. I feel cheated. Really upset with Amazon.,1.0
Pros:1. Tiny bezels2. Great colour composition3. Good collection of input options4. Vesa mount compatible5. Pocket friendlyCons:1. Inbuilt speakers are useless. They don't reproduce complete sound spectrum properly.2. Brightness is a bit low. Difficult sometimes in bright daylight3. Menu control system UI is very bad,4.0
"Please don't buy if you are trying to buy it for macbook. It doesn't work with macbook pro even with original hdmi to type c adaptor. The resolution is not good.Benq technical teams recommendation to fix this issue was to ""use different hdmi to type-c adapter available in the market"" and pray that one of them works as they have verified it from other customers, but they are not ready to share which adapter to use. Wasted 2 weeks talking to benq customer but then they are not ready to help.",1.0
"Display: I bought this monitor as a secondary display to aid my programming. The text display in Windows 10 is awfully pixelated and not at all crisp. If you are  buying this for text based usage, strictly stay away. I can't emphasize more. All the other display related features are absolutely miserable.Sound: The less we talk the better. The speaker volume and quality is fit for nothing absolutely pathetic sound. I don't know why this feature exists.The Bomb: You cannot return, can only replace. No matter how you try the display is ending up being garbageI gave 5 stars because most of the people only read 5 star ratings and I don't want my rating to slip through.",5.0
"Having used Dell Ultrasharp 24 in, I ordered this one after reading great reviews on it.  After trying all kinds of options for three days, it still tired my eyes in no time.  In comparison, I can work on DELL U2415 Display for hours!  I returned it after four days of wasted effort.  May be people who have given highly positive reviews for programming as well have not used Dell U2415.  The latter is pricey, but I am going to buy more of the same.  Nothing beats 24-inch (1920 x 1200) in crispness, quality, and very low eye strain!  The extra 200 pixels in width adds a lot to the comfort!Can't comment on gaming capabilities.",1.0
"Absolutely amazing monitor. Definitely recommended for the price. Best value for your money in the segment without a doubt. After days of research and enquiries for a 22"" monitor, and comparing it with Dell's & HP's, I ended up buying a pair of GW2283's for my video editing setup. What a delight to the eyes! Go for it without a doubt, I'm not regretting a single penny spent. Definitely at par with Dell's & HP's IPS 22"" monitors, saving you around 1k for the same performance and build quality. Maybe if you search this in your local market, you can buy it for a bit cheaper. But I had no option as such so went on via amazon.Pros-1. Although I have a dual-display setup, a single 22"" will be productive enough for most of the tasks, especially this having a 1080p res.2. This thing is built like a tank! So robust and heavy, i wasn't expecting it to be of this premium built-quality for the price I paid. This thing is HEAVY! Durability- 11/10.3. Really good panel. BENQ has been an understated brand but believe me, the actual display quality is no less than it's competition, even at comparatively lower prices. Brightness- 8/10 | Sharpness- 9/10 | Color Accuracy (in the segment)- 9/10 | Anti-glare Display- Good readability in direct light (though it reduces the overall brightness but the negotiation is worthy) | Great Viewing Angles and Adjustability- IPS panel, nothing more to say.4. I/O management deck- definitely helpful to keep things organised when you got crazy wiring all around as in my setup. Practical design.5. Also the overall packaging was really good. It came all foamed up in a double cardboard box. Good job Amazon. BENQ package was however far superior with all kinds of protection.Cons-1. No HDMi cable provided in the package, although the monitor itself has 2× HDMi ports. Just 1 VGA cable (of good quality) provided.2. Only tilt adjustment for the stand, no height and swivel adjustment, but that's just nit picking. Won't expect that from the segment.3. This thing is heavy. But definitely it has its benefits in terms of durability.4. The built-in speakers are just, meh! Not too loud, not too crisp and clear. Just average. Does the job. Sounds more like a mono rather than stereo, but I personally use headphones for my job so no big deal for me.5. It is not completely bezel-less design. There is a thin in-display bezel after the rim of the panel. Actually the overall bezel is more like 3mm from all sides when actually booted up. Its not absolutely bezeless as they show in the picture, but the crop is minimum.Verdict- Overall a great, robust, practical and powerful tool for your setup if you want durability, great display quality, performance and practicality. Nothing fancy, but still looks appealing, sleek and smooth to the eyes. Highly recommended to pick one of these uo, you wont regret for what you spend.1080p Res, 60Hz refresh rate, IPS panel features, robust design and build quality, premium looks, super practical. What else do you expect for 7.5k bucks?JUST GO FOR IT.",5.0
"I have been using multiple monitors over the year, I usually change the monitor in an year or so. This is just an amazing product. I have moved the TV and kept this monitor at its place as even my Sony bravia TV did not match the video quality of benq, I would give my 200% review for this product. If u like movies and want to watch 1080p videos on YouTube this is best. I am amazed that I spent 6000 rs almost twice a year buying bad monitors but this is best monitor with real life feeling of videos. Buy it u won't regret it.Anyone who has visited my house has said that this is a amazing And videos looks like life like video can't explain. But this is the closest I have gotten for the past 14 years to a monitor which is TRUE HD",5.0
"After seeing so many good reviews, I got this monitor hoping I’ll get a good product but was disappointed. Seller was Appario.Firstly, the amazon packaging was torn and damaged from one corner. It shows how carelessly they have handled a delicate product like this.Coming to monitor:1) I see the bottom bezels are not uniformly aligned to the screen, this was causing heavy screen bleeding from bottom.2) It claims it is an IPS display but it’s just a cheap LCD. The blacks and dark colours are horribly faded. Details are lost in shadowy parts of scenes.3) It claims to have 178 degrees viewing angle but if you’re sitting even 45 degrees from the centre the details start to get faded.4) And about speakers I’m still wondering why they even bothered putting that in the first place. Total wastage.I don’t know if all the monitors are like this or if I got a lemon. I’m starting to doubt that this is a refurbished monitor and used a cheap IPS or LCD panel which gives its such a faded look, but the other reviews said that it’s ok to have that much backlight bleed into their screen, so maybe it’s the product itself. Anyways I’m not happy about the product being an IPS display behaves like a 10 year old LCD models.Either ways I’m returning it never to buy this product again. I’ll rather check the new LG or Samsung models which I hope would give the IPS display of the quality which they claim on their products.",1.0
"I have worked for fair amount on some really good monitors and this isn't one of them. Only reason I bought this is because of 5 star ratings. Most people who have rated it 5 stars have probably not used a good display before and they got amazed easily after purchasing this. But believe me DO NOT buy this if you have already used a good monitor like Dell or Apple. You can purchase two for dual monitor setups because both have mostly similar colours. Let me tell you why I'm saying this.Pros: Cheap, Sturdy construction, thin bezels, non glossy finish unlike Samsung's or LG's ugly shiny displays. Thats it.Cons: very poor color calibration, in some cases the colours are just worn out and in some cases it gets overexposed,Speakers...they suck 2/10 score,The ports, there should have been at least one display port.Brightness (it is too bright on its default settings, you can keep it that way if you want some more addition to your electricity bill)Saturation, hue options are useless and only makes it look worse.The eye care tech is nothing but a gimmick.I have been using a Dell 21.5 inches monitor for almost 7 years now and even now its a lot better than this Benq one. My Dell monitor has thin borderless bezels, accurate colours, a good display screen and even has the ability to overclock from default 60 hz...I've raised mine to 74hz.Honestly if Dell was selling this monitor right now, I would have purchased it without a second thought. I had to purchase Benq because I needed something cheaper.Instead of the useless speakers and stupid eye care tech, they should have made a better panel with accurate colours and brightness.I am disappointed.Update: After many-many trail and errors and web research, I am somewhat able to adjust the monitor's display to somewhat accurate colours. Still I won't recommend it to people who have already used a good display.",3.0

   First i was confused between Lg, hp, and benq. Then when it comes the versatility and performance i believe benq is best brand not only for this one but all kind of of your monitor requirements.Price might be 500-1k higher in similar range, but its worthy.everything like wall mount, audio in and out, vga, power cable with out adapter, cable management is there.What i got:1.Black levels are almost like oled, its great for an ips panel (see video).2. Covers RGB, low blue light mode is great. Almost retina from 2 feet.3. Benq is solid buid, low weighing monitors (asus) shake even on using buttons.4.Recommended for binge watch and surfing and PPT and assignments stuff.5. Very great use for TN dispaly laptop extension.If you have 9k , don't think twice just get it.Ps: *used asus vz229 no audio out no wall mount.Used lg 24 inch, got burn screen issue in two years.Only Con is sound is low but accepted as its a monitor not tv.",5.0
I am writing this review after a month of usage.Pros1. Ideal size for doing office work. Eye care feature with low blue light (reading mode) is a plus.2. The main feature is the height adjustable stand. Helps in getting the most ergonomic position thereby avoiding neck pain.Cons1. Speaker is very weak. Laptop speaker is better.2. Headset port is for speaker/listening only. The port cannot be used for mic feature of the headset. So I still need to attach my headset to laptop.,4.0
"2 Weeks ReviewIf you are looking for 27inch 1080p Full HD with Affordable Price Range. This is the Best in the class available go for it as other competition are in high price range Benq is one of the best in monitors. Suitable for WFH Office and watching Movies.Pros-> Got the product Delivered on Time with proper Packing from Amazon .-> No Dead pixel seen on the product and working perfectly fine.-> Installation and Usage are easy. It comes with Power cord and one HDMI to HDMI cable.-> IT has inbuilt Speakers . Works Well if u are attending Meetings or Watching Movies when u connect your monitor to the Laptop. Helpful for long hour meeting so u can avoid connect head phone or laptop speakers.-> BenQ Brightness Intelligence. Good and Nice feature works well and get adjusted based on the surrounding light ambience.  Working on Type C display to DVI port to Monitor and HDMI port.-> Little hesitant for 1080p for 27inch where we may end up seeing pixels. But its other way around for normal Movie watching and Office work you will not see thoseCons-> Monitor has only HDMI, display Port and VGA port and Audio in.-> If you are planning to have 2 laptops connected or multiple pc then you may end up to have port availability on the Laptop of PC to have HDMI or display port or VGA. -> VGA has the limitation of only Video output. -> Display ports are not available in recent laptops they have either Type C or HDMI only . So you may end up spending addition 1500rs for type C to Display Cable  if you are planning to add mutiple monitor with 1080 p and Audio \video. ->Note: HDMI to DVI cable . PC HDMI port to DVI on monitor doesn’t work with Passive cables. Make sure you get the correct cable or adapter as the cable is not dual way support. only one direction it works.",5.0
"Purchased to use it in my dual monitor setup and it works great. The picture quality is very good, especially for the price, and after the calibration the images looks almost as good as on my 20K+ LG Ultrawide monitor. There's no issues viewing from sides as well. The thing bezel design also makes it attractive, especially for a multi-monitor setup. The anti-glare coating is also a good thing. It takes 3-4 secs extra to turn on when compared with the LG. There are many configurable options and adjustments to be made, but using the buttons are not very easy. A joystick based navigation control would've been better. There are inbuilt speakers, but they are a big let down. Should is muffled and even a ~1000 INR Bluetooth speaker will produce better sound. If you are buying it for media playback or gaming, better go for separate speakers.",4.0

I would recommend buying if you are ok with these cons.",3.0
"I bought this monitor when it became obvious I would be working from home for quite some time.The 27"" display is large enough, it's perfect for providing enough screen real-estate and the need for an extended laptop monitor is not required at-least in my opinion.The monitor has a light sensor below the BENQ logo which can adjust the brightness, but it is not useful for me at-least as my seating position does not have much of varying lighting conditions. Others may find it useful though. Please remove the plastic film over the light sensor so that it works properly.This monitor is a very good option to consider for those who are going to use it for regular home - multimedia usage and office work.Overall, happy with the purchase and great buy for the price.",4.0
"Earlier delivery and packaging was good even though there was a small tear on the outer delivery box, inside was packed with adequate thermocol, hence no damage to the product. Got monitor, HDMI cable, Power cable and monitor stand in the package.It is very easy to assemble meaning connecting the monitor to the stand, I did it myself. That way, it is very user friendly.You can tilt the monitor but can't adjust the height.This is good if you are into photo and video editing and requires a good monitor on a tight budget. It is IPS panel and LCD screen. It has one HDMI port, so you can cast using fire TV.There are Readermode, multimedia mode etc in the monitor with preadjusted settings. I use it with my desktop and cellphone. Backlight bleeding is very less. Just play with adjustments and which one you are satisfied with. I am using for 4 days now and I had used auto settings, but I feel the light green color is excessive(may be it's just me) especially on skin tones, you can try adjusting it manually.There are inbuilt speakers with this monitor(I decided to purchase this model because of that )but the speakers' sound is very feeble. It is better to connect an earphone /external speakers to the monitor through the audio in port.This is a value for money monitor. Love it.",4.0
Picture quality is very good. Loved it. Very classy and height adjustable feature is very good. It suits me and for my kid as well. I bought 24 inch and it is good enough for dual screen . It is good for working long hours,4.0

   Purchased this monitor, a few days ago, with the height adjustment capability as I have a small-medium work table on which I can raise the height of the monitor and place my MacBook/laptop in the gap between stand and screen (Pic attached). Go for height adjustment option if you have less space on table to manage laptop/keyboard and mouse or you need a tilt/rotating monitor display.After 3 days of using this monitor for my everyday office work and watching the OTT (Netflix, Prime, Youtube mostly) content, here is what I think are the pros & cons of this monitor.Display:  1. This is a full HD 1080p display the HD content looks manageable. Videos content from OTTs can be easily enjoyable.  2. Text doesn't look pixelated and for the programming/coding the portrait mode is just awesome.  3. Gets enough bright during the day even while facing direct sunlight. During the night, brightness intelligence kicks in and reduces the blue light emissions.But it's hardly noticeable.  4. The viewing angles aren't that impressive while watching video contents, but one can be comfortable working on the text, docs and excels.Sound:  1. Well, with 16 watts built-in speakers, one cannot expect a premium sound quality however I can easily manage my office Skype calls without headphones and the sound is clear.  2. When listening to OTTs or video/audio content the sound is decent enough but it's just monotonous. (let alone the HQ & Dolby). Sample video clip attached.  3. I have connected my JBL flip 3 bluetooth speaker with 3.5mm audio input to this monitor and it solves the purpose of watching/streaming video content to a great extent.Ports:  1. Has a HDMI port, a display port and a VGI port. (Sadly, no USB ports). A 3.5mm audio input port through which one can connect external speakers. (My JBL Flip 2 works like a charm).  2. Comes only with a HDMI to HDMI cable (1.5ft) and a power cord in the box.Flexibility:  1. The height adjustment option makes this monitor an excellent choice near 10K and makes the competitors run for their money with screen rotation, 30-40% tilt.  2. As the display can be raised up-to ~ a feet, it creates a good gap between the stand and screen beneath which I easily keep my PC and my phone on a Techzere laptop stand. (Saves a great amount of space for my keyboard and mouse).  3. The monitor(with height adjustment) is arguably heavy with about 6kgs of weight and my work table is wall mounted hence I am not sure I can let this monitor, along with other accessories be as is. So consider the weight, should you often tend to displace the monitor from time to time.At 11k, I find this a good addition to my WFH set-up, not good for video editing or 4K content. Only sad point is that this is MADE IN CHINA.",4.0
"The two in-built speakers are nothing but a joke. Even if place myself right up close to the the monitor (one foot from the monitor...the only thing between me and the monitor is the keyboard), the audio is very low. The volume from this monitor set to max is not even 20% from the single speaker of that of my mobile phone (Redmi Note 7) placed exactly at the same location.I am not expecting a TV like volume from this. But the speakers are not even audible. I need a monitor with built in speakers to go through some videos etc quickly without having to connect my sound bar etc.For such an awful speaker volume, they should not describe the product as one with built-in speakers. I am going to have to return this.I am not going to comment on the picture quality at this point because I have not validated it enough as I have made up my mind to return it.",2.0
"As a monitor, have nothing to complain at all. Looks elegant and have nice picture quality.The only thing I did not like are the in-built speakers which are very poor quality and also too low in volume. I did not expect deep bass, but at least the voice/treble should have been louder. We can watch news or likewise on youtube, when sitting within 3 feet of monitor, but not further. And not suitable at all for music or movies. I take one star off for the poor speakers.The brightness intelligence feature: The sensor captures direct/directional light falling on it, and not room ambient light. My room is such that the room light (LED tube light) is directly behind me, and a slight shadow falls on the monitor's light sensor, such that the monitor thinks the room is darker than it really is, and dims the brightness. So finally, had to keep the sensor auto brightness feature off.",4.0
"Review of BENQ GW2283 22"" Full HD Eye-care Tech PC Monitor -Pros -1. Nice thin bezel monitor giving more display area. Just right size for daily use for office work etc2. Full HD resolution is good for reading and office work on spreadsheets, etc.Cons -1. Bought this monitor mainly for its proprietory Eye-care technology, but didn't notice any change in display despite change in ambient lighting. Spoke with their CC who simply gave phone no of their ASC who wasn't of much help either. Managing to use it as a simple Full HD Monitor.2.  Doesn't come with any CD with drivers (as it is for 24"" Monitors of BENQ)3. Had I known about absence of Eye-care tech, I would have preferred to buy a PC Monitor with higher refresh rate (75Hz or more) as this is a 6-7 year old Monitor with 60Hz refresh rate only4. Using this Monitor with ""Low Blue Light"" setting turned on is with Brightness at 100% and Contrast at 50%, which is too high and strains the eyes. Had to disable this and choose 'User' mode and adjust Brightness and Contrast to my preferred levels, as ""Low Blue Light"" or any other option (Standard, Web Surfing, Reading) doesn't allow adjustment of Brightness or Contrast. This should have been allowed in other options too.So, am now using this Monitor in 'User' mode with very low levels of Brightness & Contrast, and choose Night mode in my Windows 10 Settings if I want to reduce Blue light exposure. Seems this is the best option for all-day users like me",2.0
"Very useful product. I like two HDMI ports, one I use to connect Amazon Fire TV or Google Chromecast while other one I use to connect with my laptop to use two screens. I connect my CPU in VGA port. Two 3.5 mm jacks in the monitor are also useful, I just connect external speaker with monitor to watch programs and movies using Fire TV or Google Chromecast without using CPU. The internal speaker inside the monitor is of no use because not much sound from it.",5.0
"Audio output speakers in the monitor is not working properly. very feeble output. Same sound at 20% and 100% volume adjustment., provided in the Monitor. Tried every adjustment in the system by maximising output from the system. When connected to external speaker from the headphone output of Monitor, getting good volume. Please analyse and see whether it's a defect in the speakers.All other features are very good and I liked the product.",3.0
"The body and screen finish feels smooth and premiumSound is properly enough for a 10/12 room if viewing 6ft awayThe frame Looks stylish and edge to edgePicture quality is fine, while the benq brightness adaptive sensor didn’t seem to change at different conditionThe image is sharp, display is bright, colours are pretty fineEyes never strain even after working 3-4 hrs straight.Overall it’s a better option than other regular monitors. Happy with my purchase",5.0
"It’s bright , doesn’t hurt your eyes Though.Love the height & size.It’s got speakers , so good for Town Hall meetings / Webinar’s ( outputs not crazy loud, but it’s good if you have a quiet room )It can be tilted , so that’s surely a good thing.And lastly it’s got a matt style screen - so no reflections or glare .Just one word of advice - this isn’t going to wow you , so I’d say office work or for students. Don’t think this is best suited for gaming .",5.0

   I bought 2 monitors on this last Aug, But one of them keep on getting issues like Horizontal pixel lines and flickering problem. So I thought it's my bad luck that I got a manufacturing defect product. So I returned it and requested for a replacement.The Amazon shipping was too good that the replacement came in 2 or 3 days .. But again this worst horizontal pixel line popped up into the replacement monitor after 1 week. So I returned  the replacement monitor too... I wonder what happened to benq.. that their monitor is not even lasting 2 weeks! I tried it 2 freaking times coz I like Benq... Now I'm in confistion that I should again go for benq or I should find some other brand ... Please suggest if you guys got any good ones other than this..because God already gave me 2 chances ... I don't wajt to spoil the third one tbh",2.0
"Excellent monitor. I've been using this product for about 1 month, and i must say its awesome. Installation of this product is super easy, even a small child can do it (if he has some common sense). Picture quality is average - but anti-glare is awesome ! (hardly has any glare). Bonus point for this monitor is that it has various modes such as office mode, multimedia mode, reading mode(which gives least strain to the eyes). So its a very feature-ful monitor with auto-brightness sensor (which works well) and also low blue light mode for very long duration of usage. Basically i am very happy with this purchase, probably can't get better than this at this price.",5.0
"Liked the monitor very much though it is not even a week.  The clarity is too good, clear and crisp display.  Some reviews say that the brightness is low but at least I did not face that issue and to me, brightness is pretty good.  Sound is very low though from the built-in speakers but then I already have good quality speakers attached to my PC, so that is not an issue at all.  Yet to try the Audio out with headphones to check the sound quality and loudness.Overall a good buy, maybe if I would have waited until the mid-July sale, I'd have got some discount.  I paid 10,575 which probably is ok if not towards the higher side.",5.0
"If you are using any Apple products like macbook pro or ipad pro which have only usb type c ports then this is not the product you should even think of it.As per benq guys below is what I receivedAs this monitor is not having USB C Type ( USB 3.1 ) port, you cannot connect the Apple i Mac Products and you may connect through a USB C Type to HDMI Converter but the compatibility cannot be guaranteed. In the market lot of Converter are available, some may compatible and some may not compatible so customer needs to check and confirm the compatibility before purchasing the same.Even when I m using original Apple connecter is doesn't support that. So if you want to risk your machine and try want to try any XYZ conneco then go ahead.",1.0
"Ordered monitor for home office. Nicely packed,delivered with one black HDMI cable and power cord.Easy to mount on table stand and stable on table.Picture quality is good with good sharpness, brightness, can spend longer hours to read, code, browse.Comes with four viewing modes for read, office, browse and movie.Set office or read mode for home office to reduce stress on eyes.Best viewing experience on all angles, anti glare.Textured plastic body of good quality.Initially want to buy 24 inches 27 inches may be too big! To get office experience 27 inches is necessary, can split screen to view two applications without opening laptop.Comes with three years warranty, can be checked at BenQ site with monitor serial#",5.0
"I bought it around August 2020 so it was the mid of COVID & this was at the right price in comparison to other 27"" monitors (Rs.14000). All others were around 20k then. There have been absolutely no issues with the monitor. It serves it's purpose well. The Read mode is very easy on the eyes & you don't need to manually change a lot of settings. In comparison to speakers of other monitors too, this one's speakers does a much better job. Definitely a must buy, if I need another monitor again.",5.0
If you are looking for eye protection/ night mode options.. it has multiple option to chose from .. has auto sensor light adjustment feature.. comes with multiple hdmi and other ports are useful..Drawback - if you have to switch screen brightness manually you will need to reach out to screen and press almost invisible buttons to adjust.Body build quality is rich and strong,4.0
"Great looker.Excellent picture quality and there is no glare. Good rendition of pictures clicked with  pro cameras of Sony, Fuji, Canon, etc. Very good for regular office work and other general routine. Probabably should be good for gaming and maybe watching movies, also.First time am using Benq products and am impressed.",5.0
"The product is well built , Delivery was a bit slow. (took almost 1 week.)But the product has good built It has a luxury feel to it, and has extra crisp viewing comfort.It also has a tilt featuer (up and down) which is convenient to use.The speakers are below average, but at this price its great to have them to simply watch you tube videos or normal windows sound.I compared it with HP screens , and found that at the same price (or less) BenQ was having speakers as well.So I went for this for regular office use.The plastic quality is top notch and the look and feel looks undeniably premium.",5.0
"I purchased this Monitor a week back and happy with the performance. Little disappointed with it's speaker because sound is very feeble and not able to use it, so you have to purchase external speaker if you would like to use it for some purpose. As  it meets my purpose So 5 star. I am generally using it for office work purpose, so no problem for me. As I need to work continuously for 9 hours it provide relax to my eyes. Thanks to this monitor's eye care system. Brightness sensor is working well and automatically adjust brightness as per surrounding . all wires are passing through it's stand holder, so no mess of wires on my desk. It's boarder-less look from all 3 sides makes it beautiful  I found all features same as per Amazon's description about the product. Thank you.",5.0

"I got this monitor to use as an external display to my mobile workstation (thanks to Work from Home due to COVID -19). Delivery was fast, well packaged, thanks again to Amazon's service.The Monitor is good enough for office jobs. With whatever setting I tried, I could not get pleasing picture quality from this. it is a full HD screen and connects over HDMI. I am not sure whether my tastes are spoiled by using iMac for over a decade! This monitor has built-in speakers, but not useful at all. However audio out provision is there which is good. There is a cable management provision, which is a nice thing to have.Overall, I can rate only 3/5, though this is sufficient for office work.",3.0
"If I could go back in time I would definitely not buy this product. The picture isn't sharp, the brightness controls are very weird - even after turning off the in built eye care or whatever they're calling it, it's still not matching up to my smaller hp monitor",3.0
"After unboxing the first impression was very good as the screen size is huge. And after powering on I felt like its a movie screen. Just wow. Awesome picture quality and bright screen. You can open many windows and work at same time. I am doing my freelance job easily now. Also I am playing game on this monitor. If you are not a e-Sports guy (who plays competitive game tournaments) then go for it. It has wall mount option so if your table shorts like me you can hang it on wall. Plus you can watch tv on it, angle of view is really wide, and the Product is very slim. Got it at ₹12999/- loved it. Aweome 🔥",5.0
"I had checked reviews of many monitors before buying opting for this one. I was looking for the following features: 28.3 inch full HD with wall mount option, tiltable screen, audio out port and in-built speakers. The BenQ GW-2480 has all these features and the price was the lowest. The audio-out port is important if you plan to use Firestick. The sound of the built-in speakers is low (as expected), The screen quality is great for my work (I'm not a gamer, so I cannot review that aspect). The menu options are easy to use and there are some useful settings that can be adjusted. The bezel is thin so it looks great and the plastic quality is great too.",5.0
"I got this Monitor for 12499( 27"" Model), and it has been a few months since I am using it.It is used primarily for Office work, and for some gaming.Pros :Clarity : The texts are sharp and clear, and there is no issue with visibility. I do not have to peek into the monitor to read, like I had to do on the laptop.Brightness : The monitor gets pretty bright. So much so that I keep it at 30% Brightness.SIze : 27"" is a pretty good size.Color Reproduction : Colors are pretty sharp, and you can select from multiple color profiles from within the monitor. I am currently playing Witcher 3 and the colors are splendid. Though this might not be a good monitor for FPS gaming, because of the response time 5ms. But it is good for games like GTA, Witcher, RDR that do not require precision.Cons :The speakers are pathetic. Even the HDMI Passthrough for Audio Circuit is pathetic. Speakers connected to laptop have much better audio that when connected to AUX port on the monitor. Though no minus points for it, since it is just an add on, and not a selling feautre.",5.0
"Bought this @13490rs(2020 june) ...which I believe is an amazing deal.The picture clarity is just stunning.Amazon packing was also very good.Gaming is little difficult with this huge size otherwise watching HD/4k movies is just great.Side bezels are very tiny, that make this display aesthetically pleasing.ps: (Malayalam) Onnum parayanila adipoli :)",5.0
"I am writing this review after 1 month of usage. This monitor has two HDMI ports which is the biggest USP. You can use this as second TV. Just connect firestick or settop box. The next best thing is reading mode which makes the screen yellowish by reducing the blue light radiation just like in mobiles. Very good for kids. The inbuilt speakers are also good. It is loud enough for music and videos viewed from 1 to 2 mtrs. It has headphone output too. The display panel is IPS with very good viewing angles and a good response time. Good for games too. The build quality is also good and it looks stylish with very small bezel. My previous monitor was also Benq which lasted 12 years. I hope this one will too last that long. Just go for it. Note the 24"" version does not have 2 HDMI ports, it has 1 HDMI and 1 Digital Display. Hence if u want 2 HDMI ports then go for22"" monitor.",5.0
"My first buy of a BenQ product. Though I knew the Qisda the holder of this brand I have never worked on BenQ monitors before. I purchased seeing the flicker free and eye care ads on this product with a great pricing. Well the buy is not disappointing. The product looks and works exactly as advertised. Most plus are very little glare, and the auto settings feature. With auto-settings enabled, it adapts to the lighting conditions around and making it comfortable. The only caveat with that is, when switched ON, it starts with full brightness and you will need to look somewhere away anticipating that. In a second or two it will be brought in to control, but that should have been set in the other way - start with medium brightness/contrast level and then adjust it to optimal level. This can be fixed with a firmware update - I hope BenQ will have to address this as soon as possible. On the other hand, the sound on the monitor - just don't expect any good. You have two speakers for just to have it. It is not loud enough and not any good quality sound to hear from it as well.",5.0
"The picture quality is very good. 5 stars.The Audio is useless. 1 star for it.ONE issue with the viewing is that the screen  adjustments are mannual. During the day time Eye care intillegence work, but during the night we have to manually reduce the brightness and the contrast to avoid straining the eves. So this has to be done every day, it's not worth the price. 2 star for itOver all 3 star",3.0
"Brightness is good but the adjustment settings not brightness are for good.Eye care working very fineScreen quality according to price good but sometimes when you using  Microsoft product like paint, word or other software some time you feel bluri view i think this because Microsoft software not full hd icons.Overall conclusion 4/5 to this screenDesign i like and fliker technology fully working",4.0
"Full HD, Anti- glare, yes ! comparable to other great branded monitors.  but 1 star less is because packaging includes  a VGA cable.. NO HDMI CABLE ! So again i got to run to a shop to buy a HDMI cable......  and Sound quality is like those mini speakers about 3 to 4 decades ago that used to be available for walkman !!! If you love music, you'll NOT love these built in speakers !!! So please dont rely on these built in speakers to satisfy your ears...I hope they start shipping it soon with HDMI cable instead.. thanks !",4.0
It is a very good product for the price range of 9K. The adjustable warmth and light sensor makes it conducive for any ambient environments. Viewing angle is pretty good. Exterior finish is premium matte makes it look cozy. I have tried connecting with my set top box and the picture quality is awesome than my TV. Sound quality is not so bad with the inbuilt speakers. Overall I would rate 5 as it does a good job for the price range.The only thing I feel on the negative side is that the height adjustment. This monitor leg supports only tilt angle.,5.0
"Nice monitor for occasional use, who wants big screen at cheap price.But not advisable for regular use because of poor sharpness.It has minor blur effect due to pixelation all over the monitor, which makes my eyes to strain much. Long use leads to eye pain.Thanks.",3.0
"This is the first monitor I've seen which ships with 16Amp power cable. In the normal environment where you work with normal sockets and multi sockets, where would you find a power socket.Hdmi Cable is not there as expected.",2.0
"I had earlier my 24 inch HP LP2475w monitor. After ordering this 27 inch Benq monitor I thought it is a upgrade to my old monitor. But the pixels are so big that it can be easily seen. This was really downgrade for me. I am unsatisfied. My old 24 inch LCD monitor pixels was better.The built quality is very very good compared to my another 22inch led dell monitor which you can see back of this monitor image. It is quiet heavy too. Speakers are normal, not loud.It is good for students. Not so good for designers, small text editors and photoshop editors.So guys please decide if you want to upgrade to 27 inch, think of at least 2k resolution.Thanks for reading.Hope it helps you to buy what you want,,,TC",3.0

   Update on 14th June : After writing my Last review on 3rd June I got a Call from Deepak (from BenQ HQ Gurgaon) very next day and offered to replace within a Week as they figured out my Monitor has some Panel issues. The New monitor received as a replacement works like a Charm. Kudos to BenQ team.1st Review : 3rd June[Refer the Video attached] When the new Monitor arrived it was working fine - however after using continuously for 6 month for WFH it started showing Rectangular Rings and Frequent Flickering around the Screen Border. I contacted the BenQ support and they said this issue is common with BenQ and it will go away after sometime. AND yes this issue did go after 3-4 hrs and screen as good as earlier. BUT after one this issue again came and nowadays it is too frequent which hampers the WFH productivity. This issue is so uncertain that it can came during you meeting presentation or while watching movies. Lets hope BenQ provides a replacement.",5.0
The picture quality is Amazing. Quality and color reproduction is Amazing. It is IPS panel with the most accurate color accuracy. The refresh rate is 5ms which may be a problem for some gamers. But until you are doing coding or movie or binge watch the refresh rate will never ever bug you. It is just visible when reading a running text ( who does read a running text ? Document file is stable always 🙌 still it soemone cares about it they can check that) good dark levels I use it with my laptop as its screen was not enough for me. The bezels are very very thin which is just awesome. Complete screen experience.,5.0
"Updated review after 10 months of use:Pros:-- Looks nice-- Multiple connection options-- Lower price compared to Samsung, LGCons:-- Monitor started flickering within a year-- Different colours started appearing around the screen on different times-- Audio quality is very low and not practically usable. Even volume of my laptop/mobile is much louder than the volume of the monitor.",1.0
"Very Impressive monitor to help attend video calls and work from home.  The volume of  the built-in speaker is a bit on the lower side. But that is not an issue as with a good set of headphones or external speakers, it is addressed.  I bought it mainly for working by connecting my laptop for which it is an excellent monitor. The piece that was delivered initially had a dead pixel.  However appreciate the smooth replacement process in Amazon, it was perfectly handled. Kudos...!!! to Amazon....",5.0

I got my monitor today and it doesn't include HDMI. I'll have to spend extra and wait more now to use it.Hate the experience even though I like the monitor.

"Purchased this monitor for urgent need by seeing majority of 5-star ratings. Received this item today and unboxed it to find it as a substandard product. Not value for money. Repenting now for my buy since Amazon said I cannot exchange it unless it has some defect in it.This is pretty old product it seems (2017). There is another new GL series (July-2020) LED monitor from BenQ available at same price(10K), description shows as LED monitor, when I was searching it was in the list recommended by Amazon, bad...-The picture quality is not good.-Sound quality is also poor.-On the box it's mentioned as LED, but backside of monitor it's mentioned as LCD.-Almost 6 inches of desk width it occupies on the computer table due to it's poor design of stand. This leads to strain on eyes.Another observation: This 24 inch monitor causing a toll on eyes so don't buy 24-inch for WFH with 2-ft wide computer desk. better go for 22-inch.",2.0
It is better than other cheap va/ips panel of similar size and price. I have another one from acer(27inch 75hz).Picture quality of this panel is good and you get 70% srgb color gamete.I am using same Benq monitor for dual monitor setup. Incase you plan to go for dual monitor like me. You need to manually calibrate the color since it would be lil difference out of the box.,4.0

Most importantly, at work, I use Miro boards extensively which are now looking so much better with this screen size. Keep up the great product line, BenQ!",5.0
The height adjuster is smooth and has good range. The tilt is also good and has a good range. I keep it next to my 21.5 iMac as a dual monitor. No flicker. Good on eyes.Cons (common to all monitors): Wish these monitor move away from button driven menu for setting. It is very hard.,5.0

To be honest, this should have been at least Rs 1500 - 2000/- cheaper than the selling price. I purchased it for 9750/-.",5.0
I have been using it for more than 3 months and i can say its overall excellent monitor if you are using it for your work and software development related task ! Colour grade  are vibrant and smooth which doesn't result in eye pain if you sit in front of it for more than 5-6 hours in a day !Not suitable for gamers they would require higher refresher rate which it doesn't has but if your main purpose is not gaming just buy it wont be disappointed at all !,5.0

   It is too good. I was little hesitant about the company initially but thank God it's too good. Delivery was excellent and so is the product.

"Looked around for budget range of 24"" IPS FHD monitors and had these options - LG 24MPxxxx, Benq GW2480, Dell P2419H, SE2418H and an Acer variant. The Dell monitor seemed perfect fit when it came to features - height adjustment, USB 3.0 hub connectivity, rotation in addition to what I find in this Benq model. However, I found this display at a festival discount offer and the price difference made me purchase this model (INR 7.5k vs INR 12.5k).1. Delivery experience : First time I had an experience of receiving a damaged product for an Amazon Order. But the resolution was smooth. I ordered a replacement online immediately after unpacking and the replacement was delivered within 2 days. Quite impressed with the service.2. Display quality : Most people have already commented on display quality. The build quality seems decent, IPS display is  beautiful at a viewing distance of 2-2.5ft, I enabled blue light filter at all times and it doesn't strain the eyes at all, cable management facility is neat - my desk is uncluttered and I find the Windows scaling setting at 100% ideal for my daily use. I do not game and neither am I into professional multimedia editing and I do not believe anyone who does one or both of these should even be considering this display. There are alternatives for those use cases.3. Speaker : haven't used it and never used it with earlier monitors either. I hope people don't consider this an essential feature for monitors. It shouldn't be.Overall a nice, economical upgrade to my 20"" 720p LCD monitor. I hope the product is as durable as my earlier monitors.",4.0

I got the monitor for my office work and the display is pretty crisp.. it also loads content extremely fast as soon as connected to laptop via HDMI cableThe inbuilt cable management system is a boon to avoid messing /tangling of cables.The only downside so far are the built in speakers which are not at all loud even at high volume.,4.0
"I am not a gamer so the rating given for gaming represents ""I do not know"". As I am using it for software development work it serves my purpose fullest. It has good brightness range to take care of daylight as well as night work situation. I did some photo editing as well and found the colors natural and not adding any tint. Did not do any extensive color tests as I am not going to use it for serious photo/video reproduction.  I do coding and this monitor works for me.",5.0
Value for money monitor. Supports vesa mounting for all mounting.  Monitor is 5 cm thick so quite minimal footprint. The stand which comes with monitor is also quite good with wire management and is also very sleek. A laptop can also rest on top of the stand bottom in an inclined manner without any problems providing for a clutter free desk.,5.0
"The package contained 15A power 3-pin power cable. As you know, no one has a 15A power socket near their computer station. I had to contact the BenQ support and request them to send normal 10A power cable. Monitor was delivered on 5th May and the correct power cable was delivered on 18th May. I could not use the monitor till then. I do not understand how such a basic packaging mistake (and quality check) could be done by a reputed company such as BenQ.",3.0
"What a great product!!I am very pleased with it. Matt finish. Doesn't reflect nearby objects/images on screen.Good sober colours.I had 22"" Dell earlier, which was very good too. This seems so much bigger & comfortable to eyes. Less strain.Good quality make. Well packed.",5.0
"I got this after  I had purchased a cheap ADCOM monitor  for my Raspberry Pi.  After using the cheap monitor this was a big  relief for the eyes. The pic quality is very  good. I  like the two HDMI ports so I can connect my Laptop as well. Sound quality is terrible, you must connect external speakers.",4.0
This monitor produces excellent colors with good brightness and contrast. The eye protection is very good for night-time working. I think they should've removed the speaker from the monitor completely to reduce the cost because the speaker volume is too low. Even my headphones produce a louder sounds.,4.0
This is good monitor overall but the sound is too low. You must rely on your either PC/laptop or external audio that too connected to your computer/laptop. Expect to get low audio when compared to connect jack to your device. and you already know it doesn't have mic. But the speakers are decent enough for hearing inside closed room like bedroom.,3.0
Great Monitor and timely delivery by Amazon. Included in the box is a 16A Power adapter and VGA to VGA cables which are both useless to most people. Ensure you've a 6A power adapter and HDMI cable in spare before ordering,4.0
"Pros1. It has a good viewing angle due to IPS technology.2. It has its own night mode kind of Eye-care which is good.3. At this price You won't get this specification in other brands like samsung and LG.Cons1. If you want a less bezel monitor. This is not a good choice2. If you are planning to buy 2 pieces of this product and connect to play games , the bezel will irritate you. And hence not a good choice.3. Black are not black in this monitor. I have hp elite book and I have a wallpaper of black color . Beleive me they appear far different on both screens ( my laptop and this monitor).4 . Same as point number 3 , colors are not accurate. So , movie and gaming experience may be a bit low due refresh rate and color accuracy.Final verdict.If you searching for a monitor for office work like coding, browsing, MS office kind of work, Go for it . This is an excellent choice.Don't buy for gaming and video/photo editing.",4.0

I will update about the monitor quality once i got replacement.Update : Got New Replacement & it was working fine.",4.0
"It's been month after purchasing this monitor and I am happy with it. Only issue I felt that Display portnot detected when HDMI cable is already connected. For that you have to remove HDMI cable, plug Display port cable and again plug HDMI cable. No issues with VGA. Menu is intuitive. Buttons can be more sturdy. Overall good product in this range.",4.0
I installed the monitor after a month and I find there is an issue with the power connection. It connect only if I keep the power cable in particular angle. N have to be very careful else power goes of which is really frustrating,2.0
Monitor is averagely good. They shipped a wrong power cable ( 15A) with the monitor so i had to buy  a 5A myself.  No easy way to reach support.  The form factor looks fine.  Overall I may have just gone for a dell. The audio is ok for the price and helps to atleast watch videos without an external monitor.,3.0
It's a very good product for ppl who are looking for dual monitor setup.Picture quality is good.Pros : 1) Picture Quality2) Price3) Decent sound4) 2 HDMI portsCons :Didn't came across any so far.Good buy for the price.,5.0
"For the 27"" Monitor, 1920 x 1080 is not the apt resolution. If you are going with 27"" It is advisable to purchase a 4k Resolution monitor.  cos ppi is 81 but it is advisable to have Above 140 ppi for 27"" . which is why the monitor is getting pixelated. Choose wisely before selecting, Because there is no exchange on the product with Seller only Replacement can be made that too if there is any defect or damage. My suggestion is not to buy this product.",1.0
Product  does not come with HDMI cable and the power plug needs 16amps socket which is commonly used for A/Cs and Geysers and not for  other common electric appliances.  Needed to replace the existing one with a new 16amps socket  after failing to make the Amazon customer service understand the problem and see if any possibility of getting another cable with low amp power plug.  One needs to add these additional expenses .Apart from above it looks to be a good product as of now.,4.0
"I was super easy to set up. The cable holder at the back helps to keep the wires neat. I'm happy with 'tilt' option which is more than enough for my needs. Haven't had any display problems for the past month since I've purchased this monitor. My one peeve is that it's a bit cumbersome to change the settings and I switch between reading, multimedia and web surfing multiple times. I guess that's a small price to pay for a monitor that comes at such a low price and excellent value.",5.0
"One of the best monitors.Excellent quality of contrast, wide viewing angles.Top notch IPS panel.I do not know how it suits for gaming as I use it for office work. But It can be a trusted versatile product.Thanks Amazon for providing such top notch products.",5.0
The monitor has 16 amp socket and non returnable. It will not fit in multi pin plug. So only two option is if you have a 16 amp socket or you use a converter for 16amp to 6 amp so that it fits with multi pin socket. Later is highly risky as it will lead to power failure or short circuit. Not able to return it on day 1 itself,1.0
The eycare technology and the Adaptive Brightness are the main takeaways. Ever simce i changed to this monitor the dark circles and redness in the eyes have reduced very noticeably.It is a good monitor for gaming purposes and the picture quality is also great. The speaker on this monitor are not that loud but they do the job. Who uses monitor speakers anyway?The black is not that black in this monitor or maybe some settings are needed to be done. Prefer this monitor at this price over other overrated monitors.,5.0
"Worst and faulty...the resolution looks blurry right from first day, I don't even have option to return it now as dur to being out of town I checked it after end date, I have purchased benq monitor earlier which was good.

I’ve been using this monitor for more than 2 years now. And I must say its a very nice monitor for all kinds of usage. I mainly run graphic design softwares like adobe photoshop and illustrator and this monitor produces very good colours which are important in my work. Full HD videos and Gaming grapgic is also very nice. At this price this monitor is steal. I’m pretty happy with my purchase!,4.0
The picture quality is nice. I do not have any complain for its display section. However I have failed to use its audio system. I have tried to get output from the speaker using my available devices. It failed to give any sound when the input is given through its hdmi port or audio line-in jack. It appears to me that there is some fault in the section that implements the audio system. It is my suggestion to viewers that you should check both the video and audio system before giving any rating to it.,2.0
"Picture quality is great, viewing angles are great. The controls are accurate.2 areas of improvement:Built in speaker sound quality isn't good. The sound levels are really low.Why does this monitor come with a 16a socket? Had to replace the power cable.",4.0
The product itself is good and hence this is my second order... but still I returned the product.Please please read this before you buy. This comes with a power chord which is pretty big generally used for high voltage equipments like geyser. This power chord will not fit to normal switch board so it has following drawbacks1. It cannot be used where ever you want as such high voltage switch boards are not generally be installed2. Even if you use a bigger switch board typically ups will not be compatible so when power is cutoff monitor won't work3. An additional adapter may be required if you still want to keep,1.0
Great product from Benq. Guys go for it blindly. Such a quality monitor. Brightness is extraordinary. I was using Acer LCD monitor since 2009. For the first time I'm using IPS monitor. Great difference i can see from both. I'm loving and using daily. Matte finish display is an advantage thay doesn't affect ur view from sunlight through window. Previously i have that issue. Now no issues with this Matte finish display.,5.0

One of the best 24 inch monitor in this price range. Picture quality is decent. Refresh rate is satisfactory for moderate gamers. I use it for editing works. Auto brightness feature is not too helpful but it's OK. Bezel is very thin which looks great. But there is some gap between the screen and the plastic cover which can accumulate dirt over time. But overall this is the best monitor under 10K I could get after doing a lot of research online.,4.0
My idea was to build my dream rig a triple monitor setup so I went through a lot of research and decided to go for BenQ 27 inch ips (since I am gamer/digital concept artist/content creator) but soon I learned that this 27 inch is too much for 1080p resolution. this monitor has good viewing angle and no problem with panel or anything but be a smarter choice would be 24 inch insted of 27 because the image feels stretched (by the way works great with my PS4 slim),5.0

"Received this item on 30/06/2020, the item is very good in terms of the monitor. The size is also adequate. Size greater than this like 24"" monitor or 27"" monitor becomes very big. This can not be used as TV because of two reasons. The first reason is inbuilt speakers are not of good quality and level is also quite low. The second reason is it is a monitor so it does come with a remote to change input source from HDMI1 to HDM2 or to VGA, so, you need to change the input source by clicking on buttons below the monitor.",4.0

   This monitor (BenQ GW2480) is one of the best Full HD display monitor in very less price.This is the full review of this monitor and lets just do with in the box contents, Pros, Cons and finally the Conclusion.Feel free to checkout my profile.-------------------------------------------------IN THE BOX CONTENTS-------------------------------------------------1. Some manuals with one CD.2. Power Cable.3. HDMI cable.4. Monitor itself.---------------------------------------------PROS OF THIS MONITOR--------------------------------------------1. It comes with a great design and those bezels, I love them because it looks so awesome at looking at that full screen with that almost bezel free design.2. The viewing experience is just great. This display produces very nice colors and with the IPS LED display it is almost perfect to view from sides.3. There are also inbuilt speakers and for this kind of design and price they just sounds nice.4. It comes with HDMI, VGA and Display port input.5. One of the best feature that I like id that cable management system. Every cable hides perfectly under that cover for cables.6. There is also a feature of automatic brightness and it works really fine in this monitor.7. The display quality is just remarkable and it is flicker free display.8. The stand of this laptop has a great textured design and the same texture is on the back of this monitor.9. It also comes with the wall mounting holes in it.10. Finally coming to the price than, I think this kind of price and a the features that company is offering is just great.-------------------------------------------CONS OF THIS MONITOR-------------------------------------------The only thing that I did not liked it that it does not come with the VGA cable in the box.CONCLUSION: Finally, It is a great monitor. Comes with almost bezel free design, Automatic brightness, wall mounting and other great features. For these all I think this kind of price is just fine and it makes the way to my great buying list and I am happy with it.",5.0
"I used this monitor to build my own cost efficient and stylish AIO! This is a gorgeous monitor with the following specs that fit my needs:1. Edge-to-edge full HD display which makes it look larger than a 24""2. Built in speakers3. VESA compatible - for mounting my NUC box4. Cable management - to effectively conceal the cables and retain the look of an AIO5. Not too expensive6. Good looking baseCons: It came with one stuck (always on) red pixel. I used PixelHealer program to get rid of it and it's perfect now.I'd definitely recommend this monitor.",5.0
"I bought this monitor as a secondary screen. overall quality is good specially in this price range. I already have Dell S2415H which is amazing. This dell monitor is discontinued, so i decided to buy a chep monitor to do my video editing work. I was expecting that this Benq monitor will have glossy ips pannel like my dell one, but it's not. it has matt finish  ips pannel. so if anyone is looking for glossy ips pannel then it's not for you. I found only one downside in this monitor and that is the brightness level. it is not that much bright if i compare it with my dell one. But it's quite perfect for non editors and for home use. you won't notice much difference in color reproduction. However I won't recommand this as a primary screen for photo and video editors. Build quality is bit chrap though this is expected in this price range. Overall I'm very much satisfied with my purchase for secondary screen. Here i would like to say special thanks to amazon for timely delivery and replacement of my received damaged product. I just placed a replacrment of my product within one or two hours of receiving it. And they replaced it very next day with a new monitor. It was a great experience to shop with amazon. Where I had faced so much difficulties with othe online shopping site like flipkart and shop clues.",4.0
