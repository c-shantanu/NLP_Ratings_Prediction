This amazon playing very cheap games to the customers. I have ordered this product on 29th for almost 29k and now the sale daybits cost around 23k. How fooling the customers for this kind of false pricings and every product has 10days return policy but now its not acceptable reurns it accepts only replacement. What a cheap gameplay amazon. If you really think about the customer do some promising thing not such kind of fraud things. Never ever i buyer in amazon again. Good bye. You lost a loyal customer. I may not do anything for you except stop ordering from you. That enough to added advantage to your competitors.,1.0

"Amazing product, got 1+1 extended warranty. Using it for a while- working good and got the product in clean and sealed condition.Pros:1.amazing picture quality2. Handy3.light weight4.gripping is good5. Best features with WiFi and nfc,can transfer images directly to phone or pc. 6. Memory card and one battery is includedCons:1. Camera carrying bag is small2. No extra battery with package you have buy extra one for backup3. Don't come with screen protector, you have to buy it for LCD  display protection from scratches.",5.0
"# DSLR at feasible price# Excellent picture quality#Sturdy body with ergonomic design which is easy to grasp# Compatible with accessory lens like tele zoom lens and macro lens (which are not a part of standard lens kit)#Easy to operate#Fairly good battery life#Easy connectivity with multiple options- wireless, USB,HDMI etc",5.0
"I bought this camera, its was working well with 18-55 lens, but when i move to 55-255 the performance was low.battery backup also very less.But overall good camera. At night 55-255 lens take hell alot time to focus.So my suggestion is go for 200D. Amazon wont refund for it, so i sell the camera on OLX",3.0
Camera is gud one..... But i brought it on 'no cost emi (970.86)' of 6months @25376.14 after the deduction of 970.86. Now my EMI is 4391.16 for 6months...that comes 26346.96...So my question is how will i get the no cost benefit of 970.86?,2.0
"First of all. I ordered this product in Amazon great sale at 34000, but next day the price was 30000. I am very disappointed with it. Camera is for beginners, who wants to learn about basic photography. It's for casual use. If you want a proper professional camera for photography, then I would suggest go for 70d or further.",1.0
This camera is only for photography ...u can't record a good video... because it doesn't have continuous autofocus while video recording....even mobile phones have that function.... the auto focus is fixed while video recording...like if u move in your video..then u get out of focus...which is disgusting.. because video means a movie a moving object...,1.0
"The product is absolutely perfect but Amazon service is not professional. Don't buy this if you are going to shoot videos bcoz it doesn't support mic, Amazon will not tell you this in their description of product. I lost my 10k because of Amazon they mention ""10 days returnable"" but it is actually ""10 day exchangeable"". They totally denied to take it back. Be careful when you are buying it.",3.0
I have purchased this Canon DSLR after a small research. It's results were fantastic as a digital camera. But just after few months of purchase I found that sometimes it's shutter starts operating automatically without clicking any picture. Sometimes it worked ok but sometimes automatically opening and closing of shutter with annoying noice started. Then I contacted Canon serice centre. They gave me address of local service centre at Jabalpur MP. I gave them my camera for repairing. They sent it to Indore city workshop and it took nearly one and half month to return me. It was working ok at that time but after few days that shutter problem started again.Now I can not give this camera to workshop again and again so I am using this faulty camera as sometimes it works ok but sometimes it doesn't work due to shutter problem.I thought earlier that Canon was excellent brand but now my thinking is totally changed about it.,1.0
Good for Beginners. Using this product for more than year now and working perfectly fine. Purposely did'nt wrote review earlier. Now I can say this product is really good. Amazon delivered in good way.Recommande to Beginners who are looking for good DSLR.,5.0
"It's a good camera for beginners.Update: I found that the mini USB cable was not working. When I registered the camera in canon edge website, I got an option to extend the warranty but it didn't extend for 1 year, I just got 4 months extra, which means that the camera was registered long back.I just checked the manufacturing date and was surprised to see that it was manufactured over 17 months ago!Please check the camera thoroughly for any bad signs.I applied for replacement and let's see.....what happens.",1.0
Amazon delivered a second hand product.The Canon Digital camera package seal  was broken and it was opened several times by previous users. The camera was with full of finger print marks. There was no provision for return of product. I am not satisfied with a second hand product with price for the original product.,3.0
"Very beginner friendly. I bought it for my cousin  who is a complete newbie in photography. And he took this picture (attached) in his first day. The focus speed is not as good as Nikon entry levels, and the battery backup is slightly worse as well. But the color profile is much better in Canon. The details are very close to Nikon D5600. Only major negative is fixed display. But again wifi mobile  connection really helps.",5.0
I can say it's a best camera for photography.This is my first dslr I bought during Amazon sale @22k. I was confused between nikon d3500 & canon 1500d after getting the amazing feedback from my photographer friends I chose to go with canon brand.This was my first shoot I did with the 18-55mm kit lense & got wonderful results. I'm looking forward to buy 1 50mm F1.4 lens to upgrade my potrait shoot.Thanks alot Amazon your service & support can never be matched!,5.0
Got it for 19k during festival salesIncredible for that priceEasy to use and good picture qualityEasy to transfer photos via nfcGood battery also,5.0
I am using past 6 months and till now I am very much satisfied from this product using day light photography but I do not know what settings are required to capture night light photo.. using default auto setting. So it's drawback or my lack of knowledge. If I get setting details from product seller then fine picture quality at night then I will revise my rating.,4.0
It's my first time DSLR very nice product.i really like it .I also inquiry before purchasing it canonn 1500d . I found Nikon 3500 vs to canonn 1500d . really it's very nice . but Amazon company delivery person very bad.he didn't delivery my mention My attitude is dependent upon the way u treat me..i will take my product another person talk with him.amazone company should be look into this matter,5.0
