"could've used invisible light, like so many other mice do now a days. it's accurate, a little too sensitive, as in, it'll work even if you're not completely touching the surface on which you've kept the mouse. so lifting the mouse a little to place it in a new place during gaming is a little tricky. build quality is good, scroll wheel is soft and has a nice click, size is comfortable.reducing stars because of low quality, fragile, thin wire.READ MORE",3.0

From March 2017 to this date i'm using the mouse. It is working flawless. Being too small is not recommended for those who may be working on design or using mouse constantly.

"For the price, this is a fantastic small computer mouse. But for those rough usage, this won't last longer. I had different experiences on each time I purchased this.

And the third time it's going good till now.READ MORE",4.0
