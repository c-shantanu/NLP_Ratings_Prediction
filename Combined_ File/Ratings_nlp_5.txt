review,rating
"My first smartwatch. I think it has good value for money. For a low price of 2500 INR, I got a solid performer. I have had smartbands before, but they are like teasers for smartwatches. I wanted to have a proper smartwatch and decided to go with an Indian brand, since Indian brands like Noise and Boat have started making great products. I have to say, I am happy with my decision. The product is easy to use and setup. There have been no drops in connectivity since I have started using it. And most importantly, wearing it all day doesn't make me feel uncomfortable in anyway. It gives me a good track of what I need to know when I am working out and what to aim for. Now, I am really wondering, what is the value point for a smart watch? For 2500 INR I get features like heart rate monitoring, around 10 work out modes, calorie counter and notifications sync with my phone,  what else is really needed for a smart watch?",4.0
"Well, now that the product is in use since last almost a month, now I am in a state to write a review.Product looks good. But functions are not as expected. The response time to couple of seconds late. If you want to see the time, you can't see it instantly, rather you have to shake your hand a bit and after 2-3 seconds the time will flash. It's not convenient. So all the initial excitement of my son has gone. He doesn't wear it regularly now a days.Not good at this price point.",4.0
"The watch OS and the NoiseFit app are utter garbage.I will list some of the issues:1) Watch does not track heart rate 24/7 even though it has the option. It always shows my heart rate as 62 bpm unless I check it manually.2) Half of the time when I try to check the heart rate manually, the watch randomly crashes and restarts (losing some of the day's tracked data along the way)3) Don't even get me started about sports mode... It just doesn't started (maybe just for me, but that's a huge issue).4) The watch itself is half decent, but the watch OS and app make it worthless (for me).I do not care about the fancy features they tried to put (like music control) if they can't even get the basic features of the watch right.",1.0
"Like:External build - Comparable to that of IWatch. Premium feel is thereAccuracy is good.All common fitness features are available2799 is a very good price for a watch of this size displayGood choice of face displays.Batter backup is decent.Dislike:Display is not full. Only part of the dial contains display.Contrast is not very good.Touch can be better.Notifications has a limitation of reading only upto 70 characters.Only 5mts bluetooth range, gets easily disconnected, especially if there are walls in between.NoiseFit app is heavily consuming battery on my phone. It needs location/GPS services to be ON all the time.I tried for one day, and it consumed 74% of total battery consumption. It was a deal breaker for me as i dont want any thing on my phone that drains phone's battery. But app as such has good UI.No reset to factory settings option.",4.0
Previously i faced connection issue. Tgen i wrote to Noise and sent for exchange. They sent back the same device with full of scratches. With in 1 month now the screen displays like attached picture. Really i got disappointed with noise and my first worst experience with Amazon.I dont what to do this with device. Waste of money.... Complete loss.,1.0
"I guess it's hyped just coz it looks good and classy. But it doesn't work well.. I bought it few months back and haven't even used much. First of all, the automatic screen sensor stopped working after few days.. The walking steps doesn't count.. I've tried to track it with the app but the watch is not detecting any.. It worked fine in the initial days but now it's like.. I can only use it for seeing time and date. That, we can do in other better and cheap watches as well.Very disappointed. This was in my wish list from i don't know how long.. But now i don't even wear it..",2.0

  ¬†Every thing is ok exept Bluetooth connection. Watch is disconnected each and every time.And it does not connect automatically have to search through app every time which is very irritating.",2.0
"A very VFM product that you can buy in this range. I like the details that are plotted on to the charts on the app. Especially with sleep tracking, giving the details about sleep quality and the start and stop time as well.The accuracy of this data is quite good too. I used to use another activity tracker prior to this and the step could calculation is much more streamlined on Noise compared to the other.Touch screen response is okay. Would have certainly loved if the touch screen responded to sweaty fingers too. If you are working out or jogging, it won't recognise your touch if the fingers are wet.Battery back up is good as well. This review is based on my 5 months of usage.",4.0
"Many write the pros. I'll list the cons only.Very less watch faces in comparison to honor band 5 which I purchased at same time.No social media alerts from MiUI 11 (Android 7 based).Now after 2 weeks is usage, the magnets in the unique charging point in the watch has come off. Dislodged from the watch. Not happy.SMS and call alerts are working.",2.0
"What I like :- Looks good- Feels good, comfortable on the skin- Reminds me to stay active when inactive for a while- Alarm function- Timer functionWhat needs to be improved:- Calories burnt calculation seems to be not accurate- The calories burnt during the workout isn't displayed on total energy spent on the main dial- While working out, you can't turn on the timer (not able to switch from the workout mode)- Sleep calculation is inaccurateMy main requirements being the ability to tell time, have a stopwatch function without using the phone, etc. it's good. But if you want the energy calculation to be accurate, I would not recommend this.",4.0
Overall watch looks good.Almost all Features are good for real time tracking.I had done its water resistant test in pool amd it found absolutely good.Only one major disadvantage of this watch is its battery life is not enough (just 3 days support) hence i need to charge it many times.,5.0
"If you are looking for an average smartwatch then noise colourfit Pro 2 is a good option . You get a lots of option like heart rate monitoring which is not that accurate and upto the expectations but not at all bad in the price you pay for watch , 24*7 activity tracking via dedicated app is a plus here but then come on not a fancy at all , sports mode check , fitness tracking check , sleep monitoring check , screen is a little less touch sensitive which is a minus , i have used the watch for more than two months now and yes all i can write is a good watch , battery life is üëç , like i literally go like a week on full charge with a heavy usage , so yes a good watch in overall . Is overpriced üëé",3.0
"Horrible product. The app sucks and step count is beyond inaccurate. It doesn't count steps when disconnected from the app which happens more frequently than you realize. Amazfit is easy to use, go for it. India should ban noise products. All reviews on this have been misleading.",2.0
"I bought this watch a few months back. It is working perfectly and I have no problems with this. It's touch screen, sleep tracking, sports, alarm, etc are awesome. In many reviews I saw that they say that it is not working properly and blah blah..... Please do not agree with them. This is an awesome product. You should definitely buy this. Thanks to Amazon also that it delivered the proxy on the same day of ordering.",5.0
Not satisfied with Product quality as well interface ..!!,1.0
Good for the price and amount of money you are spending. A teenager would love this watch.Look and feel of the watch is good.The display is small. It's almost 60 to 70 percent of the total watch face or dial.Call notification works well you can see the name on the display it gives you a option to reject the call if you want.Touch is not as sensitive and responsive as you use in the mobile or a tab.Music control is a good feature and works well.Other features works well like Steps. Heart beat. Sleep quality but is subject to calibration buts keeps a record of them in your noisefit app.,3.0
"Excellent product  and excellent  customer services. My product got hanged some days back and after  online registration  of complain, my watch was picked by them and repaired  it at their workshop in Delhi and delivered back at my place with a 15 days . Excellent  services!",5.0

  ¬†It‚Äôs the best smart watch I have ever seen. Before this one, I had the MI smart band 4. And this watch is much better than MI smart band 4. It‚Äôs touchscreen doesn‚Äôt lag and whenever somebody sees this watch the first time, they have only one Question. ‚Äú Applewatch, right!‚Äù I love this product üíó",5.0
The step numbers are very small. We are senior citizens and can only read it with a magnifying glass. The connection with mobile doesn't always work smoothly. The hand flip to light the face doesn't always work. Amazon refused to take it back and only offered replacement which is no good for us.,1.0
"So I have used Honor Band 5 and Mi Band 3 and they are much better at being a fitness band as compared to this ( so called watch ). Doesn't track pulse properly at all, naps are not recorded. The app doesn't realise how to take smart average, if I am not wearing for 2 days of week it counts them in my avg sleep. Touch is bad too. Invest a bit more if you want a fitness watch or buy a band at this range.",2.0
I thought that this will be a great product and bought with great expectations. This is a huge dud from the company. The only positive I found is the build of the smartwatch.Cons:1. Low quality UI2. Not so great user-friendly Noisefit app3. Response time is very slow on the smartwatch,1.0
"After 7 months I writting my review about the watch as below:-1. Display and style is very good, it really win my heart2. Step counting completely wrong. Waste of money. Don't buy3. Calories burn completely wrong. Waste of money. Don't buy.I have tried reset the settings in app in intial days just to reconfirm, I might have entered wrong input but after using it for 6 months now, I only use it as a basic watch in my hand.",3.0
"Pairing the device is a big challenge.  Within three days i installed the app 10 times.Also the notifications are not happening all times.I was not happy, but Amazon is saying we can only exchange the product.  If the customer is not happy, then u should take back the product.  Don't insist him to use it once again the same new one.First impression is the best impression",2.0
"NOISE COLORFIT PRO 2AFTER USING THE WATCH FOR A WEEKThis is a very good product. It has various features . The watch can go for 7 days without charging. The look of this watch is very stylish . I can wear it as a sporty yet glamorous look .For people with thin wrists , it will fit just right . I , myself have a thin wrists and it fits me perfectly. The watch is very compatible with today's world.THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE THIS WATCH BETTER I do see the hours of sleep in my app but it would have been better if it was visible on the watch. It has minor glitching when you are shifting the screens . Other wise the touch screen is pretty good.SUGGESTION I would totally suggest to buy this watch. It is a great buy.",4.0
"Worst Product. The advertisement shows something else, actual watch is diffrent. The display is pathetic so as touch. Just like any other chinese watch",1.0
"The watch does not connect or notify whatsapp messages qnd calls  also GPS required to be turned on when using noise app. Overall, it just qualifies the designation of a plastic toy to check steps. Mi band is a better cheaper choice.",2.0
"Just today(24-July-2020) i got this product, as per the instructions i charged for 2hr, but still it didn‚Äôt work, when i was packing it back to return saw that fourth  button it‚Äôs having rust in it.

"I have been using this product for about 6 months, so far so good. noiseapp could have been developed better and mainly on Iphone it has synch issues,You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone battery backup is good. there are good and bad about this product here is the list.Good- Price, Looks, touch screen, battery backupBad-Step calculation and Heart rate reading is not accurate, mainly the Noise app on iphone is not good.",4.0
I have been using this from last 3 months. Watch face is durable and resistant to small scratches. Well built and serves the purpose. Liked about battery which is long lasting and apperence. Only suggestion is to increase the number of watch faces.,5.0
The app misbehaves often and step count suddenly reverts to an earlier status. Sleep is not accurately counted unless it is deep sleep. Bluetooth connection is often problematic. Additional features like blood pressure monitoring will be useful.,3.0
"This product is well packed and user manual is good. You cant connect with your smartphone directly with bluetooth. You need to download noisefit app for that and need to connect your watch. Connectivity is good. Fraction of seconds delay on notification. Display is good, feel is good. Looks is very good. SMS, like whats app, msg, facebook and other app notification you can see only. You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone(unless the msg is one liner).Heart rate monitor is closely correct. Step count is good. Sports mode is great. Real count of a cumulative of 3 steps. Alarm works well. Truly water proof.",4.0
I am a 12 years old guy. This watch is next level. I got this as my diwali gift and I would say that this is the best diwali gift I have ever received.Pros- Touch screen is super smooth.  Looks premium.  Watch faces are awesome.  Gives accurate measurements.Cons- Didn't find any.Conclusion- Highly recommended.,5.0
A very bad buy... Incorrect step and distance counts... Not sure if other things are calculated accurately... Had faced a lot of problems in getting call notifications started on the watch... Service center guys took the watch from me after a compliant saying they will replace it and then gave me the same piece again... No watch faces available now... Bought it in October 2020 and had to register 1 complaint every 30 to 40 days for some or the other issues,1.0
"Very worst product, after two weeks touch screen stop working, I had raised complaints they collected  the watch  af that no update. Also raised refund ticket but still it also not resolved. My suggestion do not trust this type of product, it's full wastage of money.",5.0

This product is good for use but the after buying with 5 months i faced problem with the charging port and went to noise for a replace as was under replacement term but the workshop people clamied that it is company policy that they dont give new peice they give the peice which is repaired and product is of another customer,2.0
This watch is KACRA please don't buy this product it is not worth fr 100/-Quality is worse none of the system works&amazon don't gives u the refund alsoSo pls don't go fr this product,1.0
"I don‚Äôt wanna blame Amazon, service is good as always.. This product is POS..! None of the monitors are working.. It‚Äôs a dead device in just 6 months.. And funny thing is, I need to manually sync the device to make sure that it shows time at latest.. lol.. Please refrain from buying this and wasting your money.. There are cheaper products on Amazon which works better than this",1.0
Watch is all okay.. No issues till now.. but the app for this watch which is Noisefit app is just worst.. it was good only for 2-3 days then it started creating problem.. my watch record my every activity but it didn't showed up in the app so many times. I do workout daily in 4 sessions so i want proper record and sometimes it doesn't show 2 or 3 sessions and some i lost the whole day activity.. i complained about that to the app costumer service on whatsapp. So they  came up with a temporary solution that is uninstall the app and reinstall. And when i did so in the middle of the day i lost all the data.. from app and watch too..,3.0
"I bought this product by looking the design..but later i cime to know this is not at all worth.its not at all calculating your steps and heart beat too..worrest product really.i want to send it back , but unfortunately i didn't find any Refund policy for this worrest Watch.The only best thing is charging will be long lasting..and if you want a stylish one,you can go a head..",1.0
"Review after 10 days usageSeemed waste of money at first but got an update in noise pro app and it just worked fine .1)Good connectivity, though notification are little late ( 1 second roughly)2)heart rate is good almost accurate, checked in parallel with medical device3) battery backup is great  almost just as they say 10 days battery Cons1) no spo22) though display is good but notifications and call alert seems not a eye catcher Overall don't go by the old reviews just buy the product  I bought it for2499",4.0
"Good looking, small dial, not suitable for man with big hands, no much features, just d basic, anyway what will u expect at this price,but ok for young kids,not for real men.",2.0
"The connectivity of smartwatch with smartphone is very poor. Once watch got disconnected from smartphone, we need to restart our phone to reconnect otherwise it will not connect. This process is very hectic. Another problem is that we have to on the mobile data, bluetooth, and location of the smartphone continuously to remain connected with the smartwatch while many other brands allows us to off mobile data and location but their smartwatch work properly. Therefore in my opinion, the purchase is waste of money. I strongly dislike the product.",1.0
"Decent build qualityAffordable priceBetter functionalityBelow average screen qualityAccesibilty/ Icons not that goodConnectivity issues (not that frequent, but its there )If you are looking for a smart watch to track the walking/running activity, Time and to get call/ message alerts you can definitely go for it .",4.0
"Amazon's delivery was excellent, as usual.The Noise Colorfit Pro 2 is a massive disappointment. The heart rate monitor is quite erratic; I've worn the watch tight and loose but can't figure out how to get it to work consistently. And, the sleep tracking is essentially non-existent.With the above two functions being so bad, I just can't trust any other information it supposedly gives.",2.0
Excellent Packaging Before time delivery many video shows it lacks a lot but if you update the firmware version it does not lack at all .. the best part is you can change the wallpaper of dial as well from official Noise app. The only major clawback is if you twist you hand to see the notification or timings it takes 3 seconds to react . No compromise on design and looks worth to buy very light in weigh just 35gms .. different color straps available in market.I best experience is IPV68 Water proof technology I worn and went on Bike Ride once I received it today and it was superb experience in total 5 star for water proof as even water on dial screen it reacted quickly while on low light or high lights .,5.0
This product not expectations. Disopinted noise company brand. Price may be R.s.2000 below blue tooth issue .not connecting properly and disconnected some times.u think price is high,2.0
Watch is good and user friendly. Touch screen is also soft and smooth. Themes for the watch are few but good. Connectivity is also good. I tried during swimming and GYM and its water resistant. There are different modes to track according to activity.,5.0
It's been a month or so. The product looks good but not as useful as I assumed it would be. One has to remember to switch on the modes everytime like walking/running etc so it doesn't automatically track. Also the heart rate isn't very accurate. Overall the design is quite nice and works very basic. Don't seem to get call notifications for some reason.The product developers can definitely work on the shortcomings so it's a seamless experience.,3.0
The best thing about the product is battery lifestep tracking is good (not the best)things you don't get is a perfect activity trackertotal calories burnt for a 2.45 km running and 2.45 km walking was the same that itcalculates calories burnet in case of distance and time taken instead of personalized way,3.0
"I was not expecting the product strap color to be a bright red color, and after wearing for a few days look what it did to my wrist ? It's just me or this is happening to others too",3.0
It is not worthy of 2799/-.....its battery back is just 1 day and as soon as battery level drop to around 85% it stops showing even the time and the screen looks like tv with burnt picture tube.And the worst thing is its noise fit app which will ask you to update it again n again.bluetooth connectivity is very poor..always asking for synchronise the watch. Not a product with this much price...it is worthy of 1000/- rs watch only.Don' buy it...go for a expensive one.,1.0

this smart watches so amazing at this price point if you got in the Amazon prime day sale you will get in 2500 and at this price point this is the best watch but the brightness in the daytime is like little bit of issue because we can't see the time properly but yeah it's like amazing. and a request to Amazon to provide us case for protection of the dial of noise colorfit Pro 2 like and apple watch.,5.0

In my opinion in this price range the smartwatch is best but if you have some more money in your budget you should go for Noise Colorfit Nav. But if you have a limited budget then go for it. This smartwatch is good.Some features that i like about this watch -:1 first of all the battery life is very good. One charge should last about 20 days with normal use.2 It's censors provide accurate hearthrate and sleep tracking.3 The chaging cable comes with magnet.,4.0

"This product is meant to be with every fitness freak..and a person who needs a smart watch but cannot afford very pricy products...NOISE is one such company that has always maintained its standard and is worth its price.

It is a nice product with good features. Looks stylish and can wear on formal as well as on casual.But very much disappointed with the aftersale service. My strap got broken & I want a new one black color strap from last 3week it is out of  stock even not available on other online shopping platform. Because of strap I didn't wore my watch from 3 weeks. Kindly help to find black color strap.,2.0
This watch is very nice. I have been using it for two months under normal conditions and it is still as good as new except for a few scratches. The screen is good and has a fast response time. The features are amazing and useful. Totally go for it if you want a lit smartwatch for less money.,5.0
"Watch is good it's sleek as well good looking,only problem is sometimes the walking running tracking is not so accurateThere are less watch faces but they are good ones I think noisefit app should update their watch faces regularly as well as they should also improve their app compared to other watches appOverall I am happy with the watch if you want to buy a good looking smart fitness band and don't have budget this is the best option for you to go with.",5.0
"Firstly I was very obsessed to wear the watch on my wrist like it seemed to be the most valueable and precious gadget I have ever purchased. On moving towards the watch I personally recommend all the ios watch users to come and have a look at this ColorFit Pro 2 smart watch, whenever I used to wear it I strongly get attached to the Premium type watch feeling it gives to me. Yeah no doubt the watch is worth to it but small dissapointments I'm facing generally with the app and limited watch faces in the watch. I hope this would be fixed soon.Thank you!",5.0
"Feedback after one month use-Pathetic watch. Takes ages to connect to phone, data disappears suddenly and resets itself.If you follow all instructions to keep their app running in background, it eats up your phone battery at an alarming speed.Multiple times my step count shows as zero but activity tracker shows full duration of activity.

I didn't liked the lagging of the watch.

It is not a smart watch. It tracks the activity wrong. I ran 5kms but noise recorded it as 7.8km apart from that it is annoying. Don't buy that otherwise I will be wasting your money.

I like everything in noise smart watch compared to mi band but there is no use of music control in this watch because it not works properlyEverything except music control is best at this price range and the company must give screen guard along with the watch because those available screen guards from online stores are not good .One thing is Amazon delivery service is goodüôÇ,4.0
