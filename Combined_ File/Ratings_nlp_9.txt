review,rating
"I bought this after reading many reviews¬†on Amazon but the sound quality was very average which is very similar to¬†other cheap price product in market. The audio is clear¬†but no bass. If you like music with bass than this speaker is not for you. It works like a charm with Bluetooth connectivity, but the sound quality gets distorted.If you are seriously looking for a good quality sound output with some decent bass, then this speaker is not the one to consider. After giving this a trial...¬†I bought Mifa A1 and to my surprise this was the one I was waiting for. Sound quality is superb and as the brand claims.. This speaker is actually water resistant. The build quality is great and battery backup is surprisingly good.¬†The main difference between JBL Go and Mifa A1¬†1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sound quality is very clear and powerful in Mifa A1. In JBL Go the sound starts cracking after you increase the volume.2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The battery backup of MIFA is around 8 hours whereas of JBL is only 2¬†hours.3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I poured 2 glasses of water on MIFA and it didn‚Äôt¬†affected its operation on sound. For JBL, I can‚Äôt even think of doing so.4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The BT version of JBL go is 4.1 whereas MIFA A1 has 4.2 version.5. Size and lookwise MIFA A1 is better then JBL Go.",3.0
"Average speaker, i bought it for watching movies on Mac book air. its loudest volume is equal to the laptop. Quite low performance, Bluetooth doesn't have password, so anyone can connect, its pretty frustrating. other brands like boat etc are much better. Not recommended.",3.0
"I was using JBL go since last one year and it was awesome and just upgraded to this jbl go 2 ,it has all feature same as JBL go and below are differences which I could find1)JBL Go 2 is water proof2)JBL go to 2 has good baas compared to JBL go3)Bluetooth range littile higher than JBL go4)JBL go2 has vibration because it has good baas so when u r using this speaker keep in safe place because on full volume it falls down if u keep on corner places or u use this during bath‚ò∫Ô∏è then it fall down this was not the case with JBL Go but this is not an issue it's because sound bass is very good.5)JBL go had one side charging &Aux cable point which JBL GO 2 also has but its covered so looks good. Also this speaker design is better than JBL go howeverOne minor change JBL go has option other side of charging point u could tie the speaker in ur bag or somewhere but that has been removed from JBL go 26)JBL go 2 also comes with usb cable but no charger or aux cable as it was in JBL go also7)Battery is also same as previous versionOverall JBL go2 design and sound quality wise  better than JBL Go but littile high in the pricing .",4.0
"Excellent product from JBL, I really loved it. It‚Äôs sound it‚Äôs compactness. It‚Äôs a portable speaker made for music lovers. It‚Äôs connectivity also very easy and fast. It‚Äôs durable and I will definitely recommend you to buy. The best part is it has a AUX in put and a mic which allows you to speak through the mic when u attend a phone call . And it has really clear sound without any noise. But one thing I have noticed that it has very poor performance when comes to its battery. It lasts hardly 4 hrs when u play nonstop music with loud volume.But apart from that its a fabulous product. Go for it.",5.0
"After a detailed research bought this as a gift. I am already using the original JBL GO for more than 2 years and am really impressed with the output. Hence had a peace of mind while buying this. The GO 2 is a good product and highly portable. Its is fairly loud and has a decent amount if bass (while nothing as compared to the higher models of JBL / Sony / Bose).In a nutshell if you are looking for a great speaker within the 2k bracket, which is portable and produces good sound quality, then this is the product for you.",4.0
"Excellent product from JBL, I really loved it.Connectivity:- 9/10Pros-Bluetooth version: 4.1 make the connectivity very easy&fast.Cons-There is no password facility so it may bother to someone who love to personalize the things.  For me it's not an issue.Other options for connectivity:- 10/10It has a AUX input and a mic which allows you to speak through the mic when u attend a phone call .Portability:-10/10It‚Äôs a portable speaker made for music lovers. It's very compact and light weight so very easy to port it anywhere and enjoy the music.Sound Quality:-The sound quality of the speaker is excellent. It's base is able to full a 10*10 room completely. It's only 3.1W RMS but sound output is fantastic.Color Options:- 10/10I ordered Teal color. It's also available in different colors which are following: Teal, Yellow, Pink , Blue, Grey, Orange ,Red ,Black. So nobody will be dissatisfied as there are many color variants. Choose the one which you love.Battery performance:- 8/10 Lithium-ion polymer (3.7V, 730mAh). Battery is slightly weaker than other Famous Brands like Bose, Amazon Basic. But it's not a big difference. It gives Up-to 5 hours battery backup with full volume . It's sufficient. Other Brands give up-to 6 hours battery back with full Volume so it's not a big difference until it matters to you.Best thing , it takes only 2.5 hours to charge it fully.Pricing :-9/10Price is genuine as per the quality. Other Brands are also in the same price range so price is competitive.Finally I can say it's a must buy product.",5.0
Love the size and portability.. Not much difference in sound power.. Good for indoor purposes,4.0

  ¬†An excellent product from the sound giant JBL. Sound is loud enough . Bass wansn't extraordinary but reasonable.  100% waterproof.  It had a very good blootooth connectivity. Sound is enough to fill a room and it was distinct and clear.In build  Mic was working properly for my cellphone( google assistant, voice call etc.).It had an auxillary port . Excellent product in this price range with a great branding and a 1 year warrenty. Indeed you can go for it. üòäüòä",5.0
"Superb voice. With good copy of songs, you get feeling of 'fullness' of voice in the room of 10 X 10 feet size. Bass is little less than expected but those who listen old melodies, Indian classical etc it's sufficient to enjoy. Gets connected easily to Android phone. You can pick up and answer right from the speaker. I didn't check battery power so can't comment about it.",5.0
"Truth be told I'm not much of a techie person. So if you're looking for a really professional review using big terms and are looking for an opinion about this product in a techie point of view don't read this review...... However what review I'll give you is my honest opinion on the product in a normal persons point of view... The sound quality of the speaker is excellent,maybe not as good as a Bose or something like that,but if you're looking for a speaker for purposes varying from chilling with friends during a sleepover or a simple dance rehearsal,then I highly recommend this. It is also very very light weight,and easy to carry around ( I for one have carried this in my pocket) The colour (I ordered the hot pink one) is bright and great if you want to make a statement. So if you leave it somewhere and forget about it, someone will probably call you up,and will also probably return it back to you because the pink is attractive and they've noticed it.(or they might not,you know, they might just take it for themselves...who knows??) So if you're looking for a speaker to begin with...then go for it,buy it..you'll love it.",5.0
"Very clearly, the day I got I really expected may be a lot ? But then a JBL speaker and let me mention it clearly again, ""an original JBL Speaker"", should or may be would sound to be really crisp and clear. Now please for damn don't say that for Rs 1399 I want a more original Bose or so to say Bowers and Wilkins or something of that cadre, but Man the clarity !??A JBL speaker would and should always have it. Don't go on my English here. Just try to understand that it seems not much real and that's what I am more concerned about. A local vendor next to my house (even if known to) may sell me a 'D' and for once that can be clear with the logics but on Amazon (which has all state of art testing and ratings) should check to it. I may be wrong here. But peeps, very clearly I feel its not real and somewhat close to it which is good but then giving us the feeling of real and playing it fake? Well that hurts :DYeah emotions are tough. But then lets not get private and into ""friendzone"" side and be practical and ask the vendors that ""Bhaiya original de do yar thode aur paise le ke!?""Kudos !",3.0
"Loud and clear, its only when you listen to other higher end expensive speakers that you realize that the bass could be better. But then for the price, its good enough.Got a slate colour, which is basically grey with a tinge of pale blue. Would have preferred a little more richer deeper shade, that's a personal choice.Am using it mainly as a speaker phone, the mid tones are clear which is great for calls. Mic is good enough as long as you don't go too far from the speaker.",5.0
"After a detailed review and comparison between many brands, I decided to purchase JBL GO 2 which is worth the money. I got this product just for 1999. I am very happy with this product so far. - Sound quality is fantastic - Bass is very good - Higher Bluetooth range compared to other brands - Speaker size is small so it's easy to carry it anywhere",5.0
The device keeps stopping in between despite of full charge... It just abrupty stops and has to be restarted....happened so many times....,1.0
It's really worth for ur money.... Quality is awesome !Highly recommended if u are particular about Quality....Fully satisfied about the performance....,5.0
"Really liked the reviews about the product so bought it last year in march 2018.But after one year in april, it stopped operating. Charging happens for 2-3 min and red light got switch off.When tried to use it in one minute blue light switec to red light and after another minute it gets switched off.Don't know why JBL, such a brand in the world of speakers, make these faulty products.As I read in the reviews most people got their money worth(which I also got for one year) but now it's completely waste.Please stop doing this to customers.",1.0

"Overhyped product. Worst sound quality. Only Loudness, No Bass. Pretty disappointed with the product.",1.0
"This is a truly nice and useful product to have.1. Very convenient for Online Meetings, Webinars which have grown & popularising especially during this lockdown time/ WFH. We can hear loud and clear sound without having to put on earphones for hours.Also more than one person can hear/participate.2. For normal phone calls, great convenience with-  a. Can receive/put/cut calls (volume Up/Down control also) without having to reach out to our mobile phone.  b. No need to hold the phone on ear or even can avoid earphones/ wire-tangles etc.  c. It‚Äôs good convenience to be able to take it wherever you are working, even bit messy areas like kitchen & bathroom etc, also with hands & ears free of phone or accessories.  d. Also great to have a family call with many persons participating or even just hearing the call.3. For listening to music, it‚Äôs good enough (or just okay sort for music enthusiasts) although lacks punchy bass, stereo effects etc.PROs:1. Very compact and light weight, so extremely portable. Can comfortably be carried in laptop/office bag, smaller handbags and women‚Äôs purses.2. Loud sound with very good clarity (typical JBL sound quality as they claim)3. Bluetooth connects really Quickly n Smoothly once we set pairing with our mobile phone.4. Sturdy build, premium looks.5. Available in 7-8 Multiple colours to match any preferences. (if you have no specific colour preference then good to go for Black which looks more decent and less prone to look dirty over its lifetime).6. Seems okay to take inside bathroom/toilet (without having to carry your smartphone also), although it‚Äôs not certified waterproof.7. Satisfaction of having quality product of a Premium Brand in sound (JBL), so peace of mind also.CONs:1. None really, especially for its size and price band.But just to mention few, first one would be lack of deep bass (which could although be acceptable being okay for the size & price).No deep or punchy bass (so new punchy-bass songs or tabla-dholki kind of music may not be quite enjoyable on JBL Go. But it‚Äôs good enough for old genre music where punchy bass may not be too important).For good bass in such small size speakers, one may need to shell out more money and go for higher range in Sony, Bose and like.2. Boxy design- just like a rectangular box. :D(JBL Go 2 is its waterproof upper version whose edges/corners are more rounded; I guess it costs about ‚Çπ500 more.)3. Price is little bit on higher side.It has in fact increased to ‚Çπ1699 while I bought it at ‚Çπ1499 at the beginning of this month itself, i.e. Jul-20 (also got additional 10% discount on SBI Credit card *ongoing offer then).*Special Tip- Check for cashback/discount offers applicable at present. Typically Amazon keeps introducing such offers with different credit/debit cards- usually of ONE Bank at a time, and typically running for 3-4 days, after which you can see it gone and same/similar offer now on some other card. Keep looking for one that you or your family/friend may have (credit/debit card).If you have just above utility/expectations as mentioned above and ok with the price then just go for it. It‚Äôs a nice tiny accessory that won‚Äôt disappoint you!Hope you find this bit lengthy n detailed but well-covered (typical my kind) review useful. :-)",5.0
"Pretty good speaker.. I use it to attend my conference calls as I have be on call for almost whole day. Battery backup is rpetty good, but I usually keep it plugged in. Only issue i thinking is, there are two modes headphone mode and headset mode(i see two options in my laptop) one mode it pretty loud and clear, but i cannot youtube if i am already on call... Other mode is very low but able to play both sounds together... I am confused because of this... For single use its perfect speaker. Mike is clear without echo.",4.0
"Sound is superb,good color, portable",5.0
"It is a nice product. No deviation from actual description of the blue tooth speaker and mic. It is sturdy yet beautiful piece, out body is attractive. Though I find it pricy because been just over a month and I get a wiggly disturbance even when the speaker is 3 meters away from the phone or laptop. This is too early to respond badly. I notice that now if take the speaker over 4 meters away from the connected device, the sound vanishes. But during lock down and with too many meetings, this is my best bet.I use it everyday for zoom calls and phone calls (up to 6-7 hours). It connects swiftly to both laptop and phone. Sound quality is good, noise cancellation is super good. No one on the other side complains of anything - my voice, volume, background noise, no issues there.",4.0

"Music play sound quality is better. But if you are thinking to buy this to use mic for calls like to attend online meetings, lecture of your kids using Zoom, Teams and/or phone calls like normal phone calls or Whatsapp calls, PLEASE PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I buy this after seeing many comments like mic is working fine, but the sound quality for calls is very bad, bass is too high that you are not able to understand what caller is talking. Mic is little good in call but due to sound clarity, you may not understand the opposite person's voice. I am honestly writing this review so that other person may not buy this and waste the money as it is not returnable product.",2.0
"Device Microphone does not work, waste of money, if you need it for Office meetings and Kids Study Classes.I bought it for both purpose....And you can return it... I tried it twice and waiting for replacement or return my money for couple of weeks.Then gave it my maid's son to listen music :)",1.0
"This is one of the finest devices for travel. Battery lasts long , easy to charge and built quality is amazing. Prices are competitive as well. I gifted this to some of my colleagues and they we're thrilled.Update after using it on a few trips . Really worth it and couldn't have asked for more. So easy to pair and the battery backup is wonderful. Good sound for such a tiny speaker and more than enough for a 12*12 room or outdoor camping spots. Overall very happy",4.0

  ¬†I was about to give a 4 üåü rating for this product as it's compact and easy to carry(which I have  nvr done) and for its sound clarity for this price range...

"I have noticed that the moment this product is used in connection with a video call (Zoom, Teams, etc.) on wireless, the quality of the wi-fi connection immediately degrades. The connection starts breaking and reconnecting repeatedly, making the overall experience of the video call extremely unpleasant.The minute I switch off the bluetooth connectivity to the speaker or switch off the speaker itself, the wireless connection is restored to it original good quality.This is a severe problem since the main reason someone would buy this speaker is for video calls and conferences.",3.0
"Even if I can help one person with this review‚Ä¶! This is a very small (exactly half the size of your 5 inch phone) and a poor quality device. The sound quality is extremely poor ‚Äì even full volume on both your phone and the device will not make it audible outside of your home. I tried with multiple songs ‚Äì both inside and outside ‚Äì same result. For meetings and calls, this will still fall short of your expectation as you have to struggle to listen because the full volume doesn‚Äôt make the sound audible enough.

"For the price paid, this provides adequate listening experience with very decent sound quality that is well balanced and clear. The highs and mids are articulated well. The bass is also present and noticeable. But do not expect rumbling deeps and thumps. This is not the speaker for that. Its a perfect speaker for casual music and for browsing YouTube videos and TedX lectures.This is definitely not my pick for serious music sessions or for group listening. This is strictly for personal use only. For a better music quality combined with Portability, I'll pick HK Onyx series.",5.0

"JBLgo2 is as same as it's predecessor jblgo but the main differences are, go2 have bass radiator, ipx7 rated water resistant and little bit stronger speaker of 3.3 watts.Go2 have heavy voice output than Go and bass radiator radiate vibrations better than other 10w speakers in this range. Some speakers looses some tones with radiating bass but in this speaker doesn't do that it produces all tones and notes are accurate at same time.

Instead, performance wise , it can beat it's seniors also. FEELS LIKE ALMOST A BIGGER SIZE SPEAKER ON ACCOUNT OF IT'S SOUND QUALITY. Sound level, Bass ,production of all sound notes.....It performs more than my expectations. I have gone mad on JBL products.

Connection is also a breeze no matter which device I use. The audio doesn't crack until somewhere between ~80-90% volume which is very good.

Calling voice input is very good, it is clear and crisp.Cons:Personally I felt that the voice quality could have been a little bit better.

My wife loves this speaker a lot. Good product for youngsters who roam out a lot !! Good product for people who listen to music and sleep !! Good in everything. Good for money. I feel it's better than Sony XB mini speaker series. The midrange and high range (more than 100Hz) are perfectly balanced but don't expect the speaker to handle low ranges (maybe below 50Hz-100Hz). That's expected for a speaker in this price range. Just go for this speaker without a second thought.,5.0

Quality is good but it is good if you're using it in a very small area. You can't at all hear the sound keeping the device in room and listening in your hall... Too small...

"color: GRAYJBL, it is a name which everybody knows in one call. It is known for its astonishing sound quality which is again proved by this speaker. JBL GO is the most amazing product JBL & AMAZON can offer in this price range. The sound is crystal clear and the bass that comes out is amazingly accurate and it is the case for every song. It is a 3W speaker but it has the capacity to fill a medium sized room to big sized room with its sound. Anyone who has a budget around 1700 and cannot decide which speaker to buy, i am surely recommending this product. Its comes with variety of colors and its build quality is very good. I am truely satisfied with the product.",5.0
I writing review for this speaker after 8 month using.bettrey life is 4 hrs after full charge. Sound quality is also good bass is not expecting like sony speaker. I bought this ‚Çπ1400 in offer time. Bluetooth connectivity is good in 5 meter range. You can receive phone call without handling mobile at charging time. I think it's ok value for money. You can bore it's sound .,4.0

The cover for usb port is too hard and material is also low quality. If you breake it in  normal use. Jbl will not provide warranty for any  elcenotic issue. They will treat it as physical damage. This usb cover will break in normal use. Mine also broken.My speaker stopped working  after 3 months but jbl refused to provide warranty syaning physical damage.,1.0
"Substandard product. No loudness. Got to carry it room to room, defeating the purpose of buying it. Not much better than cell phone speakers.  Also there is intermittent static and the sound cuts out periodically.Guess the only way to get a good speaker is to spend a ton of money. This was WAY over priced.",1.0
It's a great product. Small and light and at first  glance I thought it'd be an 'okay' product and the sound wouldn't be loud enough. But I was wrong. It goes very loud without any distortion.The only thing is there is no surround effect. And that's pretty obvious. But not a big deal for me. I love it!,5.0
"The speaker is really easy to carry because of it small size and it's connectivity is really good given the range and easy pairing.Sound is really good for pop,EDM music's just metal music's might be a little wavy.Rest it's really a good purchase for the given price.",4.0

1) Bluetooth connectivity - It works around 12 feet range and it automatically gets disconnected if you go beyond that range.2) Portablility -  10/103) Sound Quality - It's louder but if the sound of the video or the audio is low it doesn't enhance it. In that case it's bit low. And there is a slight vibration when the device is in full volume. But other than that it's just cool and louder.,4.0
"I had bought a JBL Go 2 Speaker on August 10th from Amazon that was sold by Appario.

As this is way before the warranty expires, please ensure I get a replacement or refund at the earliest.",1.0
Bluetooth disconnects automatically after about 10 minutes of non usage. Everytime you take a break when you come back you have to reconnect. That's really stupid.Battery backup is poor. Few hours at best.Sound quality is so so.For the quality and features it's overpriced.,2.0
"I wonder if there is much quality control or checks performed before shipping a piece. I have been using the speaker only for a week (3 times in total) and it has already given up! The speaker started to regularly give an additional sound (like a beat) and towards the end of my 3rd usage, distorted the sound completely! Do not know if Amazon sent me an old item or this particular one is of bad quality. I hate sending back items because I have heard if they cannot be easily refurbished, they end up in the trash - which just seems so wasteful and anti-environment.",2.0
"Lacks a bit of Power and Crispiness. Meant only for silent rooms and 'light' listening. Driver produces good bass but could use a lil extra highs. Size is small, so lack of power can be expected.Being a music producer, these are my views. Its still good for music, but can't perform well on movies until n unless u have a 100% silent room. Not tried yet, but I think it would be hard put to use it as the source of sound for more than a person or two, as sometimes, if the room has noise (just the usual ambient noise of nearby roads, AC Fan etc.), you really have to put it close to your person in order to listen clearly.",3.0
